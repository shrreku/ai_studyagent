# Detailed Step-by-Step Plan to Build AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent Demo

This plan outlines a structured approach to building the AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent demo as defined in the updated Product Requirements Document (PRD). It follows best practices in software development and project management, breaking the project into small, manageable tasks and subtasks with clear dependencies to ensure a logical progression without complexity jumps. Each task and subtask is designed to be implementable in a single step while contributing to the overall success of the project. Dependencies are wired to avoid orphan tasks, ensuring a cohesive development flow.

## High-Level Step-by-Step Plan

The development process is divided into sequential phases, each building on the previous one, to create a functional demo that showcases full-stack skills, AI integration with Crew AI, and user-centric design for internship applications.

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Initialize the development environment, tools, and version control to establish a foundation for coding.
2. **Backend Development - Core Logic and AI Orchestration:** Build the backend to process uploads, generate study plans, and handle AI interactions using Crew AI with DeepSeek V3 API via OpenRouter.
3. **Frontend Development - Initial Page (Input Form):** Create the user input interface with numerical fields for study duration and upload fields to collect data for plan generation.
4. **Frontend Development - Study Session Page:** Develop the detailed study interface with task lists, plan display, chat, and formulas for user interaction.
5. **Integration and API Connectivity:** Connect frontend and backend components to ensure seamless data flow and functionality across the app.
6. **Testing and Refinement:** Validate the app’s functionality, fix bugs, and polish the UI for a professional demo.
7. **Documentation and Deployment:** Finalize documentation and deploy the app (if feasible) to showcase the project for internship applications.

## Detailed Task Breakdown with Subtasks and Dependencies

Below, each high-level step is broken into tasks, and each task into subtasks, with checklist items, context for implementation, and dependency mappings. Task IDs are numeric, and dependencies are listed to ensure a connected workflow. 


### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement

- **Task 20: Conduct Functional Testing**
    - **ID:** 20
    - **Context:** Test the entire app flow to ensure all features work as intended, identifying and fixing critical bugs for a polished demo, following error-first mindset from FastAPI rules.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 19
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **20.1:** Test the initial page by inputting different duration values (days, hours per day) and uploading files, verifying preview plan updates correctly with backend data.
        - [ ] **20.2:** Test the study session page by checking tasks, interacting with chat, and clicking for instructions, ensuring responses are contextual via Crew AI and DeepSeek V3.
        - [ ] **20.3:** Verify UI elements (numerical inputs, checkboxes with strikethrough, scrollable formulas) function across basic screen sizes using Tailwind’s responsive classes.
        - [ ] **20.4:** Log and prioritize bugs (e.g., UI glitches, API failures) for quick fixes, implementing proper error logging as per FastAPI guidelines.
- **Task 21: Refine UI and UX**
    - **ID:** 21
    - **Context:** Polish the user interface for readability and professionalism, enhancing the demo’s appeal for internship showcases, adhering to Tailwind and Shadcn UI styling rules.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 20
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **21.1:** Adjust Tailwind CSS for consistent spacing, font sizes, and color contrast across all components (e.g., `p-4`, `text-base`) for better readability.
        - [ ] **21.2:** Add minimal visual feedback (e.g., button hover effects with `hover:bg-gray-100`, loading spinner for API calls using Shadcn UI) to improve user experience.
        - [ ] **21.3:** Ensure responsive design for mobile and tablet views using Tailwind media queries (e.g., `md:grid-cols-3`), following mobile-first approach.
        - [ ] **21.4:** Review the UI against the Study Plan Template structure (Study-Plan-Template.md) to confirm alignment with expected output format, adjusting layout if needed.
