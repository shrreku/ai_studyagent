# Detailed Step-by-Step Plan to Build AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent Demo

This plan outlines a structured approach to building the AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent demo as defined in the updated Product Requirements Document (PRD). It follows best practices in software development and project management, breaking the project into small, manageable tasks and subtasks with clear dependencies to ensure a logical progression without complexity jumps. Each task and subtask is designed to be implementable in a single step while contributing to the overall success of the project. Dependencies are wired to avoid orphan tasks, ensuring a cohesive development flow.

## High-Level Step-by-Step Plan

The development process is divided into sequential phases, each building on the previous one, to create a functional demo that showcases full-stack skills, AI integration with Crew AI, and user-centric design for internship applications.

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Initialize the development environment, tools, and version control to establish a foundation for coding.
2. **Backend Development - Core Logic and AI Orchestration:** Build the backend to process uploads, generate study plans, and handle AI interactions using Crew AI with DeepSeek V3 API via OpenRouter.
3. **Frontend Development - Initial Page (Input Form):** Create the user input interface with numerical fields for study duration and upload fields to collect data for plan generation.
4. **Frontend Development - Study Session Page:** Develop the detailed study interface with task lists, plan display, chat, and formulas for user interaction.
5. **Integration and API Connectivity:** Connect frontend and backend components to ensure seamless data flow and functionality across the app.
6. **Testing and Refinement:** Validate the appâ€™s functionality, fix bugs, and polish the UI for a professional demo.
7. **Documentation and Deployment:** Finalize documentation and deploy the app (if feasible) to showcase the project for internship applications.

## Detailed Task Breakdown with Subtasks and Dependencies

Below, each high-level step is broken into tasks, and each task into subtasks, with checklist items, context for implementation, and dependency mappings. Task IDs are numeric, and dependencies are listed to ensure a connected workflow. 


### Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

- **Task 1: Initialize Project Structure**
    - **ID:** 1
    - **Context:** Set up the basic project structure for frontend and backend to organize code and facilitate development. This ensures a clean workspace for collaboration and version control, following the modular structure guidelines from the provided rules.
    - **Dependencies:** None
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [x] **1.1:** Create a root project folder with subfolders for frontend (`/src`) and backend (`/backend`) to separate concerns as per separation of concerns principle.
        - [x] **1.2:** Initialize a new Next.js project in the frontend folder using `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript, placing `/app` and `/components` under `/src` as per Next.js rules.
        - [x] **1.3:** Initialize a new FastAPI project in the backend folder by creating a virtual environment (`python -m venv env`) and installing FastAPI (`pip install fastapi uvicorn`) for API development, following the file structure guidelines (e.g., `routers/`, `utils/`).
        - [x] **1.4:** Install basic dependencies (e.g., `axios` for frontend API calls, `python-dotenv` for backend environment variables, `pydantic` v2 for validation) to prepare for development.
- **Task 2: Set Up Version Control with GitHub**
    - **ID:** 2
    - **Context:** Establish version control to track changes and create a public repository for showcasing the project to potential internship recruiters, ensuring visibility for your SDE/ML portfolio.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 1
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [x] **2.1:** Initialize a Git repository in the root folder (`git init`) to start tracking changes.
        - [x] **2.2:** Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `env/`) from version control.
        - [x] **2.3:** Create a public GitHub repository and link it to the local project (`git remote add origin <url>`).
        - [x] **2.4:** Make an initial commit with the project structure (`git add . && git commit -m "Initial project setup"`) and push to GitHub (`git push origin main`).
