# Detailed Step-by-Step Plan to Build AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent Demo

This plan outlines a structured approach to building the AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent demo as defined in the updated Product Requirements Document (PRD). It follows best practices in software development and project management, breaking the project into small, manageable tasks and subtasks with clear dependencies to ensure a logical progression without complexity jumps. Each task and subtask is designed to be implementable in a single step while contributing to the overall success of the project. Dependencies are wired to avoid orphan tasks, ensuring a cohesive development flow.

## High-Level Step-by-Step Plan

The development process is divided into sequential phases, each building on the previous one, to create a functional demo that showcases full-stack skills, AI integration with Crew AI, and user-centric design for internship applications.

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Initialize the development environment, tools, and version control to establish a foundation for coding.
2. **Backend Development - Core Logic and AI Orchestration:** Build the backend to process uploads, generate study plans, and handle AI interactions using Crew AI with DeepSeek V3 API via OpenRouter.
3. **Frontend Development - Initial Page (Input Form):** Create the user input interface with numerical fields for study duration and upload fields to collect data for plan generation.
4. **Frontend Development - Study Session Page:** Develop the detailed study interface with task lists, plan display, chat, and formulas for user interaction.
5. **Integration and API Connectivity:** Connect frontend and backend components to ensure seamless data flow and functionality across the app.
6. **Testing and Refinement:** Validate the app’s functionality, fix bugs, and polish the UI for a professional demo.
7. **Documentation and Deployment:** Finalize documentation and deploy the app (if feasible) to showcase the project for internship applications.

## Detailed Task Breakdown with Subtasks and Dependencies

Below, each high-level step is broken into tasks, and each task into subtasks, with checklist items, context for implementation, and dependency mappings. Task IDs are numeric, and dependencies are listed to ensure a connected workflow. 


### Phase 5: Integration and API Connectivity

- **Task 18: Connect Initial Page to Backend for Plan Preview**
    - **ID:** 18
    - **Context:** Integrate the initial page’s "Preview Plan" functionality with the backend to fetch and display the draft study plan dynamically, following Next.js data fetching best practices.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 10, Task 6
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **18.1:** Implement an API call in the `InputForm` component to send calculated total hours (days × hours per day) and uploaded files to the `/upload` and `/generate-plan` endpoints using `axios`.
        - [ ] **18.2:** Update the preview section to display the real study plan data returned from the backend, structured per Study Plan Template.
        - [ ] **18.3:** Handle basic error states (e.g., upload failure, API error) with user-friendly messages in the UI using Shadcn UI components.
        - [ ] **18.4:** Test the integration by inputting duration values, uploading files, and verifying the preview updates with backend-generated plan data.
- **Task 19: Connect Study Session Page to Backend for Full Functionality**
    - **ID:** 19
    - **Context:** Ensure the study session page fetches and displays the finalized study plan and supports chat interactions via backend APIs, optimizing for performance with server components as per Next.js rules.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 14, Task 15, Task 18
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **19.1:** Pass the finalized plan data from the initial page to the `StudySession` component via state or context during redirection, minimizing client-side state as per rules.
        - [ ] **19.2:** Implement API calls in `ChatInterface` to send user queries to the `/chat` endpoint and display responses in real-time, using async fetching with `Suspense` for performance.
        - [ ] **19.3:** Ensure `TaskList`, `StudyPlanDisplay`, and `KeyFormulas` components render the latest plan data from the backend response, favoring server-side rendering where possible.
        - [ ] **19.4:** Test the full flow (input → preview → study session → chat) to confirm data consistency and API interactions work as expected, verifying Crew AI orchestration.
