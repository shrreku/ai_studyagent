## 5. Exam Strategy and Tips

- Master foundational derivations before tackling complex problems.
- Combine sketching (diagrams, plots) with algebraic work to guide calculations.
- Group similar problem types (e.g., carrier statistics, junction physics) for pattern recognition.
- Allocate time limits per question under simulated exam conditions.
- Prepare a concise formula sheet for rapid recall of critical expressions.


## 6. Final Tips

- Review each mapped tutorial question immediately after studying its concept.
- Use official solutions only to verify your approach, not as a substitute for practice.
- Adapt time allocations based on your comfort level with each topic.
- Schedule short breaks between sessions to maintain focus.

Use this framework to generate customized study plans for any subject by swapping in your course code, topics, tutorial questions, and available study materials.
