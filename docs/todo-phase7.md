# Detailed Step-by-Step Plan to Build AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent Demo

This plan outlines a structured approach to building the AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent demo as defined in the updated Product Requirements Document (PRD). It follows best practices in software development and project management, breaking the project into small, manageable tasks and subtasks with clear dependencies to ensure a logical progression without complexity jumps. Each task and subtask is designed to be implementable in a single step while contributing to the overall success of the project. Dependencies are wired to avoid orphan tasks, ensuring a cohesive development flow.

## High-Level Step-by-Step Plan

The development process is divided into sequential phases, each building on the previous one, to create a functional demo that showcases full-stack skills, AI integration with Crew AI, and user-centric design for internship applications.

1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration:** Initialize the development environment, tools, and version control to establish a foundation for coding.
2. **Backend Development - Core Logic and AI Orchestration:** Build the backend to process uploads, generate study plans, and handle AI interactions using Crew AI with DeepSeek V3 API via OpenRouter.
3. **Frontend Development - Initial Page (Input Form):** Create the user input interface with numerical fields for study duration and upload fields to collect data for plan generation.
4. **Frontend Development - Study Session Page:** Develop the detailed study interface with task lists, plan display, chat, and formulas for user interaction.
5. **Integration and API Connectivity:** Connect frontend and backend components to ensure seamless data flow and functionality across the app.
6. **Testing and Refinement:** Validate the app’s functionality, fix bugs, and polish the UI for a professional demo.
7. **Documentation and Deployment:** Finalize documentation and deploy the app (if feasible) to showcase the project for internship applications.

## Detailed Task Breakdown with Subtasks and Dependencies

Below, each high-level step is broken into tasks, and each task into subtasks, with checklist items, context for implementation, and dependency mappings. Task IDs are numeric, and dependencies are listed to ensure a connected workflow. 


### Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

- **Task 22: Finalize Documentation in README**
    - **ID:** 22
    - **Context:** Create comprehensive documentation in the GitHub README to explain the project, setup, and future enhancements for internship reviewers, showcasing technical proficiency and forward-thinking design.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 21
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **22.1:** Write a project overview in the README, describing the AI-Powered Study Assistant Agent’s purpose, relevance to EdTech, and use of Crew AI with DeepSeek V3.
        - [ ] **22.2:** Detail the tech stack (Next.js, FastAPI, Crew AI, DeepSeek V3 via OpenRouter), installation steps, and how to run the app locally (e.g., `npm start` for frontend, `uvicorn main:app` for backend).
        - [ ] **22.3:** List implemented features (e.g., numerical inputs, AI orchestration) and note future enhancements (e.g., visual cards, persistent state) to demonstrate planning.
        - [ ] **22.4:** Commit and push the updated README to GitHub for public access (`git add README.md && git commit -m "Add detailed README" && git push`).
- **Task 23: Deploy Application (Optional)**
    - **ID:** 23
    - **Context:** Deploy the app to public platforms for a live demo if feasible, enhancing visibility for internship applications, ensuring performance optimization as per rules.
    - **Dependencies:** Task 22
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] **23.1:** Deploy the frontend to Vercel by connecting the GitHub repo and following Vercel’s deployment wizard for Next.js apps, optimizing for Web Vitals (LCP, CLS).
        - [ ] **23.2:** Deploy the backend to PythonAnywhere or Replit, uploading the FastAPI code and configuring environment variables for OpenRouter API keys, using async operations for performance.
        - [ ] **23.3:** Update frontend API URLs to point to the deployed backend endpoint for seamless integration, testing connectivity.
        - [ ] **23.4:** Test the live demo to ensure all features (upload, plan generation, chat) work in the deployed environment, updating README with the live URL if successful.
