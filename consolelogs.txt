In\nSection 1.2.2 we used the term convection to describe energy transfer between a surface and\na ﬂuid moving over the surface. Convection includes energy transfer by both the bulk ﬂuid\nmotion (advection) and the random motion of ﬂuid molecules (conduction or diffusion).\nIn our treatment of convection, we have two major objectives. In addition to obtaining\nan understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie convection transfer, we wish\nto develop the means to perform convection transfer calculations. This chapter and the\nmaterial of Appendix E are devoted primarily to achieving the former objective. Physical\norigins are discussed, and relevant dimensionless parameters, as well as important analo-\ngies, are developed.\nA unique feature of this chapter is the manner in which convection mass transfer effects\nare introduced by analogy to those of convection heat transfer. In mass transfer by convec-\ntion, gross ﬂuid motion combines with diffusion to promote the transfer of a species for\nwhich there exists a concentration gradient. In this text, we focus on convection mass transfer\nthat occurs at the surface of a volatile solid or liquid due to motion of a gas over the surface.\nWith conceptual foundations established, subsequent chapters are used to develop\nuseful tools for quantifying convection effects. Chapters 7 and 8 present methods for com-\nputing the coefﬁcients associated with forced convection in external and internal ﬂow con-\nﬁgurations, respectively. Chapter 9 describes methods for determining these coefﬁcients in\nfree convection, and Chapter 10 considers the problem of convection with phase change\n(boiling and condensation). Chapter 11 develops methods for designing and evaluating the\nperformance of heat exchangers, devices that are widely used in engineering practice to\neffect heat transfer between ﬂuids.\nAccordingly, we begin by developing our understanding of the nature of convection.\n6.1The Convection Boundary Layers\nThe concept of boundary layers is central to the understanding of convection heat and\nmass transfer between a surface and a ﬂuid ﬂowing past it. In this section, velocity,\nthermal, and concentration boundary layers are described, and their relationships to the\nfriction coefﬁcient, convection heat transfer coefﬁcient, and convection mass transfer\ncoefﬁcient are introduced.\n6.1.1The Velocity Boundary Layer\nTo introduce the concept of a boundary layer, consider ﬂow over the ﬂat plate of \nFigure 6.1. When ﬂuid particles make contact with the surface, their velocity is reduced\nsigniﬁcantly relative to the ﬂuid velocity upstream of the plate, and for most situations it is\nvalid to assume that the particle velocity is zero at the wall.1These particles then act to\n1This is an approximation of the situation discussed in Section 3.9, wherein ﬂuid molecules or particles continu-\nally collide with and are reﬂected from the surface. The momentum of an individual ﬂuid particle will change in\nresponse to its collision with the surface. This effect may be described by momentum \u0003accommodation \u0003coeffi\ncients, as will be discussed in Section 8.8. In this chapter, we assume that nano- and microscale effects are not\nimportant, in which case the assumption of zero ﬂuid velocity at the wall is valid.retard the motion of particles in the adjoining ﬂuid layer, which act to retard the motion of\nparticles in the next layer, and so on until, at a distance y\u000f\tfrom the surface, the effect\nbecomes negligible. This retardation of ﬂuid motion is associated with shear\u0003stresses\u0015 acting\nin planes that are parallel to the ﬂuid velocity (Figure 6.1). With increasing distance yfrom\nthe surface, the xvelocity component of the ﬂuid, u, must then increase until it approaches the\nfree stream value u\u0003. The subscript \u0003is used to designate conditions in the free stream out-\nside the boundary layer.\nThe quantity \tis termed the boundary \u0003layer\u0003thickness, and it is typically deﬁned as the\nvalue of yfor which u\u000f0.99u\u0003. The boundary \u0003layer\u0003velocity\u0003profilrefers to the manner\nin which uvaries with ythrough the boundary layer. Accordingly, the ﬂuid ﬂow is charac-\nterized by two distinct regions, a thin ﬂuid layer (the boundary layer) in which velocity gra-\ndients and shear stresses are large and a region outside the boundary layer in which velocity\ngradients and shear stresses are negligible. With increasing distance from the leading edge,\nthe effects of viscosity penetrate farther into the free stream and the boundary layer grows\n(\tincreases with x).\nBecause it pertains to the ﬂuid velocity, the foregoing boundary layer may be referred\nto more speciﬁcally as the velocity\u0003boundary \u0003layer. It develops whenever there is ﬂuid ﬂow\nover a surface, and it is of fundamental importance to problems involving convection trans-\nport. In ﬂuid mechanics its signiﬁcance to the engineer stems from its relation to the sur-\nface shear stress \u0015s, and hence to surface frictional effects. For external ﬂows it provides the\nbasis for determining the local friction\u0003coefficien\n(6.1)\na key dimensionless parameter from which the surface frictional drag may be determined.\nAssuming a Newtonian \u0003flui, the surface shear stress may be evaluated from knowledge of\nthe velocity gradient at the surface\n(6.2)\nwhere \u0010 is a ﬂuid property known as the dynamic\u0003viscosity. In a velocity boundary layer,\nthe velocity gradient at the surface depends on the distance xfrom the leading edge of the\nplate. Therefore, the surface shear stress and friction coefﬁcient also depend on x.\n6.1.2The Thermal Boundary Layer\nJust as a velocity boundary layer develops when there is ﬂuid ﬂow over a surface, a thermal\nboundary \u0003layermust develop if the ﬂuid free stream and surface temperatures differ. Con-\nsider ﬂow over an isothermal ﬂat plate (Figure 6.2).

However, ﬂuid particles that come into contact with the\nplate achieve thermal equilibrium at the plate’s surface temperature.2In turn, these particles\nexchange energy with those in the adjoining ﬂuid layer, and temperature gradients develop\nin the ﬂuid. The region of the ﬂuid in which these temperature gradients exist is the thermal\nboundary layer, and its thickness \ttis typically deﬁned as the value of yfor which the ratio\n[(Ts\fT)/(Ts\fT\u0003)]\u000f0.99. With increasing distance from the leading edge, the effects of\nheat transfer penetrate farther into the free stream and the thermal boundary layer grows.\nThe relation between conditions in this boundary layer and the convection heat transfer\ncoefﬁcient may readily be demonstrated. At any distance xfrom the leading edge, the local\nsurface heat ﬂux may be obtained by applying Fourier’s law to the fluiat y\u000f0. That is,\n(6.3)\nThe subscript shas been used to emphasize that this is the surface heat ﬂux, but it will be\ndropped in later sections. This expression is appropriate because, at\u0003the\u0003surface,\u0003there\u0003is\u0003no\nfluidmotion \u0003and\u0003energy\u0003transfer\u0003occurs\u0003only\u0003by\u0003conduction . Recalling Newton’s law of\ncooling, we see that\n(6.4)\nand combining this with Equation 6.3, we obtain\n(6.5)\nHence, conditions in the thermal boundary layer, which strongly inﬂuence the wall tem-\nperature gradient \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0, determine the rate of heat transfer across the boundary layer.\nSince is a constant, independent of x, while increases with increasing x, \ntemperature gradients in the boundary layer must decrease with increasing x. Accordingly,\nthe magnitude of decreases with increasing x, and it follows that and h\ndecrease with increasing x.\n6.1.3The Concentration Boundary Layer\nWhen air moves past the surface of a pool of water, the liquid water will evaporate, and\nwater vapor will be transferred into the airstream. This is an example of convection mass\ntransfer. More generally, consider a binary\u0003mixtureof chemical species A and B that ﬂowsq\ns \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0\tt (Ts\fT\u0003)h\u000f\fkf \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0\nTs\fT\u0003q\ns\u000fh(Ts\fT\u0003)q\ns\u000f\fkf  \u001dT\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0380 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\nT∞\ny\nxT∞Free stream\nThermal\nboundary\nlayert(x)δ\nTsδt\u0003u∞\nT\nFIGURE6.2Thermal boundary layer \ndevelopment on an isothermal ﬂat plate.\n2Micro- and nanoscale effects are assumed to be negligible in this chapter. Hence, the thermal accommodation\ncoefﬁcient of Section 3.9 attains a value of unity, in which case the ﬂuid particles achieve thermal equilibrium\nwith the surface of the plate. Micro- and nanoscale effects will be discussed in Section 8.8.over a surface (Figure 6.3). The molar concentration (kmol/m3) of species A at the surface is\nCA,s, and in the free stream it is CA,\u0003. If CA,sdiffers from CA,\u0003, transfer of species A by con-\nvection will occur. For example, species A could be a vapor that is transferred into a gas\nstream (species B) due to evaporation at a liquid surface (as in the water example) or due to\nsublimation at a solid surface. In this situation, a concentration \u0003boundary \u0003layerwill develop\nthat is similar to the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The concentration boundary layer\nis the region of the ﬂuid in which concentration gradients exist, and its thickness \tcis typi-\ncally deﬁned as the value of yfor which [( CA,s\fCA)/(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)]\u000f0.99. With increasing\ndistance from the leading edge, the effects of species transfer penetrate farther into the free\nstream and the concentration boundary layer grows.\nSpecies transfer by convection between the surface and the free stream ﬂuid is deter-\nmined by conditions in the boundary layer, and we are interested in determining the rate at\nwhich this transfer occurs. In particular, we are interested in the molar ﬂux of species A, \n(kmol/s\u0003m2). It is helpful to recognize that the molar ﬂux associated with species transfer by\ndiffusion is determined by an expression that is analogous to Fourier’s law. For the condi-\ntions of interest in this chapter, the expression, which is termed , has the form\n(6.6)3\nwhere DABis a property of the binary mixture known as the binary\u0003diffusion\u0003coefficien . At\nany point corresponding to y\b0 in the concentration boundary layer of Figure 6.3, species\ntransfer is due to both bulk ﬂuid motion ( advection ) and diffusion. However, absent nano-\nor microscale effects and the inﬂuence of species diffusion on the velocity normal to the\nsurface, ﬂuid motion at the surface can be neglected.4Accordingly, species transfer at \nthe surface is only by diffusion, and applying Fick’s law at y\u000f0, the molar ﬂux is \n(6.7)\nThe subscript shas been used to emphasize that this is the molar ﬂux at the surface, but it will\nbe dropped in later sections. Analogous to Newton’s law of cooling, an equation can be writ-\nten that relates the molar ﬂux to the concentration difference across the boundary layer, as\n(6.8) N\nA,s\u000fhm(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)N\nA,s\u000f \fDAB \u001dCA\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0N\nA\u000f \fDAB \u001dCA\n\u001dyN\nA6.1 \u0004The Convection Boundary Layers 381\n3This expression is an approximation of a more general form of Fick’s law of diffusion (Section 14.1.3) when the\ntotal molar concentration of the mixture, C\u000fCA\u000bCB, is a constant.\n4The basis for neglecting the effects of diffusion on bulk ﬂuid motion is considered in Sections 14.2 and 14.3.CA,sδcu∞\nMixture\nof A + B\nCA,∞\ny\nxCA,∞ Free streamδc\u0003(x)\nConcentration\nboundary\nlayerCA\nFIGURE6.3Species concentration boundary\nlayer development on a ﬂat plate.where hm(m/s) is the convection \u0003mass\u0003transfer\u0003coefficien , analogous to the convection heat\ntransfer coefﬁcient. Combining Equations 6.7 and 6.8, it follows that\n(6.9)\nTherefore, conditions in the concentration boundary layer, which strongly inﬂuence the\nsurface concentration gradient , also inﬂuence the convection mass transfer coef-\nﬁcient and hence the rate of species transfer in the boundary layer.\n6.1.4Signiﬁcance of the Boundary Layers\nFor ﬂow over any surface, there will always exist a velocity boundary layer and hence sur-\nface friction. Likewise, a thermal boundary layer, and hence convection heat transfer, will\nalways exist if the surface and free stream temperatures differ. Similarly, a concentration\nboundary layer and convection mass transfer will exist if the ﬂuid’s species concentration\nat the surface differs from its species concentration in the free stream. The velocity bound-\nary layer is of extent \t(x) and is characterized by the presence of velocity gradients and\nshear stresses. The thermal boundary layer is of extent \tt(x) and is characterized by temper-\nature gradients and heat transfer. Finally, the concentration boundary layer is of extent \tc(x)\nand is characterized by concentration gradients and species transfer. Situations can arise in\nwhich all three boundary layers are present. In such cases, the boundary layers rarely grow\nat the same rate, and the values of \t, \tt, and \tcat a given location are not the same.\nFor the engineer, the principal manifestations of the three boundary layers are, respec-\ntively, surface\u0003friction, convection \u0003heat\u0003transfer, and convection \u0003mass\u0003transfer. The key\nboundary layer parameters are then the friction\u0003coefficienCfand the heatand mass\u0003transfer\nconvection \u0003coefficientsh and hm, respectively. We now turn our attention to examining\nthese key parameters, which are central to the analysis of convection heat and mass transfer\nproblems.\n6.2Local and Average Convection Coefﬁcients\n6.2.1Heat Transfer\nConsider the conditions of Figure 6.4 a. A ﬂuid of velocity Vand temperature T\u0003ﬂows over\na surface of arbitrary shape and of area As. The surface is presumed to be at a uniform \ntemperature, Ts, and if Ts&T\u0003, we know that convection heat transfer will occur. From\nSection 6.1.2, we also know that the surface heat ﬂux and convection heat transfer coefﬁ-\ncient both vary along the surface. The total\u0003heat\u0003transfer\u0003rate\u0003qmay be obtained by inte-\ngrating the local ﬂux over the entire surface. That is,\n(6.10)\nor, from Equation 6.4,\n(6.11) q\u000f(Ts\fT\u0003)\u000f\nAshdAsq\u000f\u000f\nAsq\ndAs\u001dCA/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0hm\u000f\fDAB\u001dCA/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0\nCA,s\fCA,\u0003382 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to ConvectionDeﬁning an average\u0003convection \u0003coefficien for the entire surface, the total heat transfer\nrate may also be expressed as\n(6.12)\nEquating Equations 6.11 and 6.12, it follows that the average and local convection coefﬁ-\ncients are related by an expression of the form\n(6.13)\nNote that for the special case of ﬂow over a ﬂat plate (Figure 6.4 b), hvaries only with the\ndistance xfrom the leading edge and Equation 6.13 reduces to\n(6.14)\n6.2.2Mass Transfer\nSimilar results may be obtained for convection mass transfer. If a ﬂuid of species molar\nconcentration CA,\u0003ﬂows over a surface at which the species concentration is maintained at\nsome uniform value CA,s&CA,\u0003(Figure 6.5 a), transfer of the species by convection will\noccur. From Section 6.1.3, we know that the surface molar ﬂux and convection mass\ntransfer coefﬁcient both vary along the surface. The total molar transfer rate for an entire\nsurface, NA(kmol/s), may then be expressed as\n(6.15)\nwhere the average and local mass transfer convection coefﬁcients are related by an equa-\ntion of the form\n(6.16)\nFor the ﬂat plate of Figure 6.5 b, it follows that\n(6.17) hm\u000f1\nL\u000fL\n0hmdxhm\u000f1\nAs\u000f\nAshmdAsNA\u000fhmAs(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)h\u000f1\nL\u000fL\n0hdxh\u000f1\nAs\u000f\nAshdAsq\u000fh As(Ts\fT\u0003)h6.2 \u0004Local and Average Convection Coefﬁcients 383\nV, T∞\nAs, TsdAs\n(a)u∞, T∞\nx dxLq\"\n(b)q\"\nAs, TsFIGURE6.4Local and total \nconvection heat transfer.

Accordingly,\n(6.18)\nand\n(6.19)\nwhere \u0013A(kg/m3) is the mass density of species A.5We can also write Fick’s law on a mass\nbasis by multiplying Equation 6.7 by \u0004Ato yield\n(6.20)\nFurthermore, multiplying the numerator and denominator of Equation 6.9 by \u0004Ayields an\nalternative expression for hm:\n(6.21)\nTo perform a convection mass transfer calculation, it is necessary to determine the value of\nCA,sor \u0013A,s. Such a determination may be made by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at\nthe interface between the gas and the liquid or solid phase. One implication of equilibrium\nis that the temperature of the vapor at the interface is equal to the surface temperature Ts. A\nsecond implication is that the vapor is in a saturated \u0003state, in which case thermodynamic\ntables, such as Table A.6 for water, may be used to obtain its density from knowledge of Ts.\nTo a good approximation, the molar concentration of the vapor at the surface may also be\ndetermined from the vapor pressure through application of the equation of state for an ideal\ngas.

A review of the different ways in which driving potentials, ﬂuxes, and convection coefﬁcients may\nbe formulated is provided by Webb [1].where \u0003 is the universal gas constant and psat(Ts) is the vapor pressure corresponding to\nsaturation at Ts. Note that the vapor mass density and molar concentration are related by\n\u0013A\u000f\u0004ACA.\n6.2.3The Problem of Convection\nThe local flux and/or the total transfer rate are of paramount importance in any convec-\ntion problem. These quantities may be determined from the rate equations, Equations\n6.4, 6.8, 6.12, and 6.15, which depend on knowledge of the local ( horhm) and average\n( or ) convection coefficients. It is for this reason that determination of these coeffi-\ncients is viewed as the problem of convection . However, the problem is not a simple\none, for in addition to depending on numerous fluid properties such as density, viscos-\nity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat, the coefficients depend on the surface\ngeometry and theflow conditions . This multiplicity of independent variables is attribut-\nable to the dependence of convection transfer on the boundary layers that develop on\nthe surface.\nEXAMPLE6.1\nExperimental results for the local heat transfer coefﬁcient hxfor ﬂow over a ﬂat plate with\nan extremely rough surface were found to ﬁt the relation\nwhere ais a coefﬁcient (W/m1.9\u0003K) and x\u0003(m) is the distance from the leading edge of \nthe plate.\n1.Develop an expression for the ratio of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient xfor a\nplate of length xto the local heat transfer coefﬁcient hxat x.\n2.Plot the variation of hxand xas a function of x.\nSOLUTION\nKnown: Variation of the local heat transfer coefﬁcient, hx(x).\nFind:\n1.The ratio of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient ( x) to the local value hx(x).\n2.Plot of the variation of hxand xwith x.\nSchematic:\nxT∞\nTs\u0007t(x)Boundary layer\nhx = ax–0.1hhhhhx(x)\u000fax\f0.1hmh6.2 \u0004Local and Average Convection Coefﬁcients 385Analysis:\n1.From Equation 6.14 the average value of the convection heat transfer coefﬁcient over\nthe region from 0 to xis\nSubstituting the expression for the local heat transfer coefﬁcient\nand integrating, we obtain\nor\n\u0005\n2.The variation of hxand xwith xis as follows:\nComments: Boundary layer development causes both the local and average coefﬁcients\nto decrease with increasing distance from the leading edge.

An essential step in the treatment of any convection problem is to determine\nwhether the boundary layer is laminaror turbulent. Surface friction and the convection\ntransfer rates depend strongly on which of these conditions exists.\n6.3.1Laminar and Turbulent Velocity Boundary Layers\nBoundary layer development on a ﬂat plate is illustrated in Figure 6.6. In many cases, lami-\nnar and turbulent ﬂow conditions both occur, with the laminar section preceding the turbu-\nlent section. For either condition, the ﬂuid motion is characterized by velocity components\nin the x- and y-directions. Fluid motion away from the surface is necessitated by the slowing\nof the ﬂuid near the wall as the boundary layer grows in the x-direction. Figure 6.6 shows\nthat there are sharp differences between laminar and turbulent ﬂow conditions, as described\nin the following paragraphs.\nIn the laminar boundary layer, the ﬂuid ﬂow is highly ordered and it is possible to iden-\ntify streamlines along which ﬂuid particles move. From Section 6.1.1 we know that the\nboundary layer thickness grows and that velocity gradients at y\u000f0 decrease in the stream-\nwise (increasing x) direction. From Equation 6.2, we see that the local surface shear stress\n\u0015salso decreases with increasing x. The highly ordered behavior continues until a transition\nzone is reached, across which a conversion from laminar to turbulent conditions occurs.\nConditions within the transition zone change with time, with the ﬂow sometimes exhibiting\nlaminar behavior and sometimes exhibiting the characteristics of turbulent ﬂow.\nFlow in the fully turbulent boundary layer is, in general, highly irregular and is charac-\nterized by random, three-dimensional motion of relatively large parcels of ﬂuid. Mixing\nwithin the boundary layer carries high-speed ﬂuid toward the solid surface and transfers\nslower-moving ﬂuid farther into the free stream. Much of the mixing is promoted by\nstreamwise vortices called streaksthat are generated intermittently near the ﬂat plate,\nwhere they rapidly grow and decay. Recent analytical and experimental studies have sug-\ngested that these and other coherent\u0003structures within the turbulent ﬂow can travel in waves\nat velocities that can exceed u\u0003, interact nonlinearly, and spawn the chaotic conditions that\ncharacterize turbulent ﬂow [2].6.3 \u0004Laminar and Turbulent Flow 389\nFIGURE6.6Velocity boundary layer development on a ﬂat plate.Viscous\nsublayerBuffer layerTurbulent\nregionu∞\nu∞Streamline\nv\nu\nx, uy, v\nu∞\nxc\nLaminarx\nTransitionTurbulentAs a result of the interactions that lead to chaotic ﬂow conditions, velocity and pressure\nﬂuctuations occur at any point within the turbulent boundary layer. Three different regions\nmay be delineated within the turbulent boundary layer as a function of distance from the sur-\nface. We may speak of a viscous\u0003sublayerin which transport is dominated by diffusion and the\nvelocity proﬁle is nearly linear. There is an adjoining buffer\u0003layerin which diffusion and turbu-\nlent mixing are comparable, and there is a turbulent\u0003zonein which transport is dominated by\nturbulent mixing. A comparison of the laminar and turbulent boundary layer proﬁles for the \nx-component of the velocity, provided in Figure 6.7, shows that the turbulent velocity proﬁle is\nrelatively ﬂat due to the mixing that occurs within the buffer layer and turbulent region, giving\nrise to large velocity gradients within the viscous sublayer. Hence, \u0015sis generally larger in the\nturbulent portion of the boundary layer of Figure6.6 than in the laminar portion.\nThe transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow is ultimately due to triggering \u0003mecha-\nnisms, such as the interaction of unsteady ﬂow structures that develop naturally within the\nﬂuid or small disturbances that exist within many typical boundary layers. These distur-\nbances may originate from ﬂuctuations in the free stream, or they may be induced by sur-\nface roughness or minute surface vibrations. The onset of turbulence depends on whether\nthe triggering mechanisms are ampliﬁed or attenuated in the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow, which\nin turn depends on a dimensionless grouping of parameters called the Reynolds\u0003number,\n(6.23)\nwhere, for a ﬂat plate, the characteristic length is x, the distance from the leading edge. It\nwill be shown later that the Reynolds number represents the ratio of the inertia to viscous\nforces. If the Reynolds number is small, inertia forces are insigniﬁcant relative to viscous forces.\nThe disturbances are then dissipated, and the ﬂow remains laminar. For a large Reynolds\nnumber, however, the inertia forces can be sufﬁcient to amplify the triggering mechanisms,\nand a transition to turbulence occurs.\nIn determining whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent, it is frequently rea-\nsonable to assume that transition begins at some location xc, as shown in Figure 6.6. This\nlocation is determined by the criticalReynolds number, Rex,c. For ﬂow over a ﬂat plate,\nRex,cis known to vary from approximately 105to 3\r106, depending on surface roughness\nand the turbulence level of the free stream. A representative value of\n(6.24)\nis often assumed for boundary layer calculations and, unless otherwise noted, is used for\nthe calculations of this text that involve a ﬂat plate.Rex,c \f \u0013u\u0003xc\n\u0010\u000f5\r105Rex\u000f\u0013u\u0003 x\n\u0010390 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n6Since velocity ﬂuctuates with time in turbulent ﬂow, the time-averaged velocity, , is plotted in Figure 6.7. uy\u0003= 0y\u0003= 0u(y) u_(y)u∞ u∞\nLaminar Turbulentu\nyy\u0003= 0, lam y\u0003= 0, turb<u\ny\nu\nyu\ny\nFIGURE6.7Comparison of laminar and\nturbulent velocity boundary layer proﬁles\nfor the same free stream velocity.66.3.2Laminar and Turbulent Thermal and Species \nConcentration Boundary Layers\nSince the velocity distribution determines the advective component of thermal energy or\nchemical species transfer within the boundary layer, the nature of the ﬂow also has a pro-\nfound effect on convective heat and mass transfer rates. Similar to the laminar velocity\nboundary layer, the thermal and species boundary layers grow in the streamwise (increas-\ning x) direction, temperature and species concentration gradients in the ﬂuid at y\u000f0\ndecrease in the streamwise direction, and, from Equations 6.5 and 6.9, the heat and mass\ntransfer coefﬁcients also decrease with increasing x.\nJust as it induces large velocity gradients at y\u000f0, as shown in Figure 6.7, turbulent\nmixing promotes large temperature and species concentration gradients adjacent to the solid\nsurface as well as a corresponding increase in the heat and mass transfer coefﬁcients across\nthe transition region. These effects are illustrated in Figure 6.8 for the velocity boundary\nlayer thickness \tand the local convection heat transfer coefﬁcient h. Because turbulence\ninduces mixing, which in turn reduces the importance of conduction and diffusion in deter-\nmining the thermal and species boundary layer thicknesses, differences in the thicknesses of\nthe velocity, thermal, and species boundary layers tend to be much smaller in turbulent ﬂow\nthan in laminar ﬂow. As is evident in Equation 6.24, the presence of heat and/or mass trans-\nfer can affect the location of the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow xcsince the density\nand dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid can depend on the temperature or species concentration.\nEXAMPLE6.4\nWater ﬂows at a velocity u\u0003\u000f1m/s over a ﬂat plate of length L\u000f0.6m.

The\nﬂuid is considered to be a binary mixture of species A and B, and the concentration bound-\nary layer originates from a difference between the free stream and surface concentrations\n(CA,\u0003&CA,s). Illustration of the relative thicknesses ( \tt\b\tc\b\t) in Figure 6.9 is arbitrary,\nfor the moment, and the factors that inﬂuence relative boundary layer development are dis-\ncussed later in this chapter.\nOur objective in this section is to examine the differential equations that govern the\nvelocity, temperature, and species concentration ﬁelds that are applicable to boundary layer\nﬂow with heat and species transfer. Section 6.4.1 presents the laminar boundary layer equa-\ntions, and Appendix F gives the corresponding equations for turbulent conditions. In\nSection 6.5, these equations will be used to determine important dimensionless parameters\nassociated with convection that will be used extensively in subsequent chapters. \n6.4.1Boundary Layer Equations for Laminar Flow\nMotion of a ﬂuid in which there are coexisting velocity, temperature, and concentration\ngradients must comply with several fundamental \u0003laws\u0003of\u0003nature. In particular, at each point\nin the ﬂuid, conservation \u0003of\u0003mass, energy, and chemical\u0003species, as well as sec-\nond\u0003law\u0003of\u0003motion, must be satisﬁed. Equations representing these requirements are derived\nby applying the laws to a differential control volume situated in the ﬂow. The resulting\nequations, in Cartesian coordinates, for the steady, two-dimensional \u0003floof an incompress-\nible\u0003fluiwith constant\u0003properties are given in Appendix E. These equations serve as\nstarting points for our analysis of laminar boundary layers. Note that turbulent ﬂows are\ninherently unsteady, and the equations governing them are presented in Appendix F. 394 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\nMixture\nof A + Bxyu∞\ns\nδ\nVelocity\nboundary\nlayerCA,∞  \nCA,s\nδ\nConcentration\nboundary\nlayerc\nCA,∞VT∞dy\ndxN\"A,s\nq\"s\nTs\nδ\nThermal\nboundary\nlayertT∞\nτ\nFIGURE6.9Development of the velocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers for an\narbitrary surface.\nThese\u0003equations \u0003are\u0003derived\u0003in\u0003Section\u00036S.1.We begin by restricting attention to applications for which body\u0003forces\u0003are\u0003negligible\n(X\u000fY\u000f0 in Equations E.2 and E.3), there is no\u0003thermal\u0003energy\u0003generation \u0003in\u0003the\u0003flui\n( in Equation E.4), and the flow is\u0003nonreacting (\u000f0 in Equation E.6). Additional\nsimpliﬁcations may be made by invoking approximations pertinent to conditions in the\nvelocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers. The boundary layer thicknesses are\ntypically very small relative to the size of the object upon which they form, and the x-direction\nvelocity, temperature, and concentration must change from their surface to their free stream\nvalues over these very small distances. Therefore, gradients normal to the object’s surface\nare much larger than those along the surface. As a result, we can neglect terms that repre-\nsent x-direction diffusion of momentum, thermal energy, and chemical species, relative to\ntheir y-direction counterparts. That is [3, 4]:\n(6.25)\nBy neglecting the x-direction terms, we are assuming the net shear stress, conduction heat\nﬂux, and species diffusion ﬂux in the x-direction to be negligible. Furthermore, because the\nboundary layer is so thin, the x-direction pressure gradient within the boundary layer can be\napproximated as the free stream pressure gradient:\n(6.26)\nThe form of p\u0003(x) depends on the surface geometry and may be obtained from a separate\nconsideration of ﬂow conditions in the free stream where shear stresses are negligible [5].\nHence, the pressure gradient may be treated as a known quantity.\nWith the foregoing simpliﬁcations and approximations, the overall continuity equation\nis unchanged from Equation E.1:\n(6.27)\nThis equation is an outgrowth of applying conservation of mass to the differential,\ndx\u0003dy\u00031 control volume shown in Figure 6.9. The two terms represent the netoutﬂow\n(outﬂow minus inﬂow) of mass in the x- and y-directions, the sum of which must be zero\nfor steady ﬂow.\nThe x-momentum equation (Equation E.2) reduces to:\n(6.28)\nThis equation results from application of Newton’s second law of motion in the x-direction\nto the dx\u0003dy\u00031 differential control volume in the ﬂuid.

Terms on the left-hand side account for the\nnet rate at which thermal energy leaves the control volume due to bulk fluid motion\n(advection). The first term on the right-hand side accounts for the net inflow of thermal\nenergy due to y-direction conduction. The last term on the right-hand side is what\nremains of the viscous dissipation, Equation E.5, when it is acknowledged that, in a\nboundary layer, the velocity component in the direction along the surface, u, is much\nlarger than that normal to the surface, v, and gradients normal to the surface are much larger\nthan those along the surface. In many situations this term may be neglected relative to\nthose that account for advection and conduction. However, aerodynamic heating that\naccompanies high-speed (especially supersonic) flight is a noteworthy situation in\nwhich this term is important.\nThe species conservation equation (Equation E.6) reduces to\n(6.30)\nThis equation is obtained by applying conservation of chemical species to the dx\u0003dy\u00031 differ-\nential control volume in the ﬂow. Terms on the left-hand side account for net transport of\nspecies A due to bulk ﬂuid motion (advection), while the right-hand side represents the net\ninﬂow due to y-direction diffusion.\nAfter specifying appropriate boundary conditions, Equations 6.27 through 6.30 may be\nsolved to determine the spatial variations of u, v, T, and CAin the different laminar bound-\nary layers. For incompressible, constant property ﬂow, Equations 6.27 and 6.28 are uncou-\npledfrom Equations 6.29 and 6.30. That is, Equations 6.27 and 6.28 may be solved for the\nvelocity\u0003fiel, u(x,\u0003y) and v(x,\u0003y), without consideration of Equations 6.29 and 6.30. From\nknowledge of u(x,\u0003y), the velocity gradient could then be evaluated, and the wall\nshear stress could be obtained from Equation 6.2. In contrast, through the appearance of\nuand vin Equations 6.29 and 6.30, the temperature and species concentration are coupledto\nthe velocity ﬁeld. Hence u(x,\u0003y) and v(x,\u0003y) must be known before Equations 6.29 and 6.30\nmay be solved for T(x,\u0003y) and CA(x,\u0003y). Once T(x,\u0003y) and CA(x,\u0003y) have been obtained from\nsuch solutions, the convection heat and mass transfer coefﬁcients may be determined\nfrom Equations 6.5 and 6.9, respectively. It follows that these coefﬁcients depend strongly\non the velocity ﬁeld.7\nBecause boundary layer solutions generally involve mathematics beyond the scope of\nthis text, our treatment of such solutions will be restricted to the analysis of laminar parallel(\u001du/\u001dy)\u0016y\u000f0u\u001dCA\n\u001dx\u000bv\u001dCA\n\u001dy\u000fDAB\u001d2CA\n\u001dy2396 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n7Special attention must be given to the effect of species transfer on the velocity boundary layer. Recall that\nvelocity boundary layer development is generally characterized by the existence of zero ﬂuid velocity at\u0003the\u0003sur-\nface. This condition pertains to the velocity component vnormal to the surface, as well as to the velocity compo-\nnent ualong the surface. However, if there is simultaneous mass transfer to or from the surface, it is evident that\nvcan no longer be zero at the surface. Nevertheless, for the mass transfer problems of interest in this text, it is\nreasonable to assume that v\u000f0 at the surface, which is equivalent to assuming that mass transfer has a negligi-\nble effect on the velocity boundary layer. The assumption is appropriate for many problems involving evapora-\ntion or sublimation from gas–liquid or gas–solid interfaces, respectively. It is not appropriate, however, for mass\ntransfer\u0003coolingproblems that involve large surface mass transfer rates [6]. In addition, we note that, with\nmass transfer, the boundary layer ﬂuid is a binary mixture of species A and B, and its properties should be those\nof the mixture. However, in all problems in this text, CA\u0002CBand it is reasonable to assume that the boundary\nlayer properties (such as k, \u0010, cp, etc.) are those of species B.ﬂow over a ﬂat plate (Section 7.2 and Appendix G). However, other analytical solutions are\ndiscussed in advanced texts on convection [7–9], and detailed boundary layer solutions\nmay be obtained by using numerical (ﬁnite-difference or ﬁnite-element) techniques [10]. It\nis also essential to recognize that a wide array of situations of engineering relevance\ninvolve turbulent convective heat transfer, which is both mathematically and physically\nmore complex than laminar convection. The boundary layer equations for turbulent ﬂow\nare included in Appendix F.\nIt is important to stress that we have not developed the laminar boundary layer equa-\ntions primarily for the purpose of obtaining solutions. Rather, we have been motivated\nmainly by two other considerations. One motivation has been to obtain an appreciation for\nthe physical processes that occur in boundary layers. These processes affect wall friction as\nwell as energy and species transfer in the boundary layers. A second important motivation\narises from the fact that the equations may be used to identify key boundary \u0003layer\u0003similar-\nity\u0003parameters , as well as important analogies between momentum, \u0003heat, and mass\u0003transfer\nthat have numerous practical applications. The laminar governing equations will be used\nfor this purpose in Sections 6.5 through 6.7, but the same key parameters and analogies\nhold true for turbulent conditions as well.\n6.4.2Compressible Flow\nThe equations of the foregoing section and Appendix E are restricted to incompressible ﬂows,\nthat is, for cases where the ﬂuid density can be treated as constant.8Flows in which the ﬂuids\nexperience signiﬁcant density changes as a result of pressure\u0003variations associated with the\nﬂuid motion are deemed to be compressible. The treatment of convection heat transfer associ-\nated with compressible \u0003flois beyond the scope of this text. Although liquids may nearly\nalways be treated as incompressible, density variations in ﬂowing gases should be considered\nwhen the velocity approaches or exceeds the speed of sound. Speciﬁcally, a gradual transition\nfrom incompressible to compressible ﬂow in gases occurs at a critical Mach number of \nMac\r0.3, where Ma\fV/aand Vand a\u0003are the gas velocity and speed of sound, respec-\ntively [11, 12]. For an ideal gas, a\u000f\u0019\u0017\u000bRTwhere \u000bis the ratio of speciﬁc heats, \u000b\fcp/cv, R\nis the gas constant, and the temperature is expressed in kelvins. As an example, for air at \nT\u000f300K  and p\u000f1 atm, we may assume ideal gas behavior. The gas constant is R\f\u0003/\u0004\u000f\n8315J/kmol \u0003K/28.7 kg/kmol \u000f287J/kg\u0003K and cv\fcp\fR\u000f1007J/kg \u0003K \f287J/kg\u0003K\u000f\n720J/kg\u0003K. The ratio of speciﬁc heats is therefore \u000b\u000fcp/cv\u000f1007J/kg \u0003K/720J/kg \u0003K\u000f1.4,\nand the speed of sound is a\u000f\u00191.4\r287J/kg\u0003K\r300K\u000f347m/s. Hence air ﬂowing at\n300K must be treated as being compressible if V\b0.3 \r347m/s \u000e100m/s.\nSince the material in Chapters 6 through 9 is restricted to incompressible or low-speed\nﬂow, it is important to conﬁrm that compressibility effects are not important when utilizing\nthe material to solve a convection heat transfer problem.96.4 \u0004The Boundary Layer Equations 397\n8Chapter 9 addresses ﬂows that arise due to the variation of density with temperature. These free\u0003convection\nﬂows can nearly always be treated as if the ﬂuid is incompressible but with an extra term in the momentum equa-\ntion to account for buoyancy forces.\n9Turbulence and compressibility often coincide, since large velocities can lead to large Reynolds and Mach num-\nbers. It can be shown (Problem 6.26) that, for sufﬁciently small geometries, any ﬂow that is turbulent is also\ncompressible.6.5Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized \nBoundary Layer Equations\nIf we examine Equations 6.28, 6.29, and 6.30 we note a strong similarity. In fact, if the\npressure gradient appearing in Equation 6.28 and the viscous dissipation term of Equation\n6.29 are negligible, the three equations are of the same form. Each\u0003equation\u0003is\u0003character-\nized\u0003by\u0003advection \u0003terms\u0003on\u0003the\u0003left-hand\u0003side\u0003and\u0003a\u0003diffusion\u0003term\u0003on\u0003the\u0003right-hand \u0003side.\nThis situation describes low-speed, \u0003forced\u0003convection \u0003flowswhich are found in many engi-\nneering applications. Implications of this similarity may be developed in a rational manner\nby ﬁrst nondimensionalizing the governing equations.\n6.5.1Boundary Layer Similarity Parameters\nThe boundary layer equations are normalized by ﬁrst deﬁning dimensionless independent\nvariables of the forms\n(6.31)\nwhere Lis a characteristic \u0003lengthfor the surface of interest (e.g., the length of a ﬂat plate).\nMoreover, dependent dimensionless variables may also be deﬁned as\n(6.32)\nwhere Vis the velocity upstream of the surface (Figure 6.9), and as\n(6.33)\n(6.34)\nThe dimensional variables may then be written in terms of the new dimensionless vari-\nables (for example, from Equation 6.31 x\fx*Land y\fy*L) and the resulting expres-\nsions for x, y, u, v, T, and CAmay be substituted into Equations 6.28, 6.29, and 6.30 to\nobtain the dimensionless forms of the conservation equations shown in Table 6.1. Note\nthat viscous dissipation has been neglected and that p*\f(p\u0003/\u0013V2) is a dimensionless\npressure. The y-direction boundary conditions required to solve the equations are also\nshown in the table.\nBy normalizing the boundary layer equations, three very important dimensionless simi-\nlarity\u0003parameters evolve and are introduced in Table 6.1. They are the Reynolds number,\nReL; Prandtl number, Pr; and Schmidt number, Sc. Such similarity parameters are impor-\ntant because they allow us to apply results obtained for a surface experiencing one set of\nconvective conditions to geometrically \u0003similarsurfaces experiencing entirely different con-\nditions. These conditions may vary, for example, with the ﬂuid, the ﬂuid velocity as\ndescribed by the free stream value V, and/or the size of the surface as described by the char-\nacteristic length L. As long as the similarity parameters anddimensionless boundary condi-\ntions are the same for two sets of conditions, the solutions of the differential equations of\nTable 6.1 for the nondimensional velocity, temperature, and species concentration will be\nidentical. This concept will be ampliﬁed in the remainder of this section.C*A \f CA\fCA,s\nCA,\u0003\fCA,sT* \f T\fTs\nT\u0003\fTsu* \f u\nV   and   v* \f v\nVx* \f x\nL  and  y* \f y\nL398 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to ConvectionTABLE6.1The boundary layer equations and their y-direction boundary conditions in nondimensional form\nBoundary \u0003Conditions\nBoundary Similarity\nLayer Conservation \u0003Equation Wall Free \u0003Stream Parameter(s)\nVelocity (6.35) (6.38) (6.41)\nThermal (6.36) (6.39) (6.42)\nConcentration (6.37) (6.40) (6.43) ReL, Sc\u000f\u0011\nDABC*A(x*, 0)\u000f0 C*A(x*, \u0003)\u000f1 u* \u001dC*A\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001dC*A\n\u001dy*\u000f1\nReL Sc \u001d2C*A\n\u001dy*2ReL, Pr\u000f\u0011\n\u0006T*(x*, 0)\u000f0 T*(x*, \u0003)\u000f1 u* \u001dT*\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u000f1\nReL Pr \u001d2T*\n\u001dy*2ReL\u000fVL\n\u0011u*(x*, 0)\u000f0 u*(x*, \u0003)\u000fu\u0003(x*)\nVu* \u001du*\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001du*\n\u001dy*\u000f \fdp*\ndx*\u000b1\nReL \u001d2u*\n \u001dy*2\nConvection \u0003Similarity \u0003Parameters \u0003ReL,\u0003Pr,\u0003and\u0003Sc6.5 \u0004Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized Boundary Layer Equations 3996.5.2Functional Form of the Solutions\nEquations 6.35 through 6.43 in Table 6.1 are extremely useful from the standpoint of sug-\ngesting how important boundary layer results may be simpliﬁed and generalized. The\nmomentum equation (6.35) suggests that, although conditions in the velocity boundary layer\ndepend on the ﬂuid properties \u0013 and \u0010, the velocity V, and the length scale L, this depen-\ndence may be simpliﬁed by grouping these variables in the form of the Reynolds number.\nWe therefore anticipate that the solution to Equation 6.35 will be of the functional form\n(6.44)\nSince the pressure distribution p*(x*) depends on the surface geometry and may be obtained\nindependently by considering ﬂow conditions in the free stream, the appearance of dp*/dx*\nin Equation 6.44 represents the inﬂuence of geometry on the velocity distribution.\nFrom Equations 6.2, 6.31, and 6.32, the shear stress at the surface, y*\u000f0, may be\nexpressed as\nand from Equations 6.1 and 6.41, it follows that the friction coefﬁcient is\nFriction\u0003Coefficient\n(6.45)\nFrom Equation 6.44 we also know that\nHence, for\u0003a\u0003prescribed \u0003geometry Equation 6.45 may be expressed as\n(6.46)\nThe signiﬁcance of this result should not be overlooked. Equation 6.46 states that the\nfriction coefﬁcient, a dimensionless parameter of considerable importance to the engineer,\nmay be expressed exclusively in terms of a dimensionless space coordinate and the\nReynolds number. Hence, for a prescribed geometry we expect the function that relates Cf\nto x* and ReLto be universally applicable. That is, we expect it to apply to different ﬂuids\nand over a wide range of values for Vand L.\nSimilar results may be obtained for the convection coefﬁcients of heat and mass trans-\nfer. Intuitively, we might anticipate that hdepends on the ﬂuid properties ( k, cp, \u0010, and \u0013),\nthe ﬂuid velocity V, the length scale L, and the surface geometry. However, Equation 6.36\nsuggests the manner in which this dependence may be simpliﬁed. In particular, the solution\nto this equation may be expressed in the form\n(6.47) T* \u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, Pr,  dp*\ndx*\u0007Cf\u000f2\nReL f(x*, ReL)\u001du*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f f \u0006x*, ReL,  dp*\ndx*\u0007Cf\u000f\u0015s\n\u0013V2/2\u000f2\nReL \u001du*\n\u001dy* \u0012\ny*\u000f0\u0015s\u000f\u0010 \u001du\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0 \u000f \u0006\u0010V\nL\u0007 \u001du*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0u* \u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, dp*\ndx*\u0007400 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convectionwhere the dependence on dp*/dx* originates from the inﬂuence of the geometry on the\nﬂuid motion ( u* and v*), which, in turn, affects the thermal conditions. Once again the term\ndp*/dx* represents the effect of surface geometry. From the deﬁnition of the convection\ncoefﬁcient, Equation 6.5, and the dimensionless variables, Equations 6.31 and 6.33, we\nalso obtain\nThis expression suggests deﬁning an important dependent dimensionless parameter termed\nthe Nusselt number.\nNusselt\u0003Number:\n(6.48)\nThis parameter is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface, and it pro-\nvides a measure of the convection heat transfer occurring at the surface. From Equation\n6.47 it follows that, for\u0003a\u0003prescribed \u0003geometry,\n(6.49)\nThe Nusselt number is to the thermal boundary layer what the friction coefﬁcient is to\nthe velocity boundary layer. Equation 6.49 implies that for a given geometry, the Nusselt\nnumber must be some universal\u0003functionof x*, ReL, and Pr. If this function were known, it\ncould be used to compute the value of Nufor different ﬂuids and for different values of V\nand L. From knowledge of Nu, the local convection coefﬁcient hmay be found and the\nlocalheat ﬂux may then be computed from Equation 6.4. Moreover, since the averageheat\ntransfer coefﬁcient is obtained by integrating over the surface of the body, it must be inde-\npendent of the spatial variable x*. Hence the functional dependence of the averageNusselt\nnumber is\n(6.50)\nSimilarly, it may be argued that, for mass transfer in a gas ﬂow over an evaporating liq-\nuid or a sublimating solid, the convection mass transfer coefﬁcient hmdepends on the prop-\nerties DAB, \u0013, and \u0010, the velocity V, and the characteristic length L. However, Equation 6.37\nsuggests that this dependence may be simpliﬁed. The solution to this equation must be of\nthe form\n(6.51)\nwhere the dependence on dp*/dx* again originates from the inﬂuence of the ﬂuid motion.\nFrom the deﬁnition of the convection coefﬁcient, Equation 6.9, and the dimensionless vari-\nables, Equations 6.31 and 6.34, we know that\nhm\u000f\fDAB\nL (CA,\u0003\fCA,s)\n(CA,s\f CA,\u0003) \u001dCA*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f\u000b  DAB\nL \u001dCA*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0CA*\u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, Sc, dp*\ndx*\u0007Nu\u000fhL\nkf\u000ff (ReL, Pr)Nu\u000ff\n (x*, ReL, Pr)Nu  \f hL\nkf \u000f \u000b  \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny* \u000f 0h\u000f\f  kf\nL (T\u0003\fTs)\n(Ts\fT\u0003) \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f\u000bkf\nL \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f06.5 \u0004Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized Boundary Layer Equations 401HencewemaydeﬁneadependentdimensionlessparametertermedtheSherwoodnumber( Sh).\nSherwood \u0003Number:\n(6.52)\nThis parameter is equal to the dimensionless concentration gradient at the surface, and\nit provides a measure of the convection mass transfer occurring at the surface.

As for the Nusselt number, it is also possible to work with an aver-\nageSherwood number that depends on only ReLand Sc.\n(6.54)\nFrom the foregoing development we have obtained the relevant dimensionless parame-\nters for low-speed, forced-convection boundary layers. We have done so by nondimension-\nalizing the differential equations that describe the physical processes occurring within the\nboundary layers. An alternative approach could have involved the use of dimensional\nanalysis in the form of the Buckingham pi theorem [5]. However, the success of that\nmethod depends on one’s ability to select, largely from intuition, the various parameters\nthat inﬂuence a problem. For example, knowing beforehand that \u000ff(k,\u0003cp, \u0013, \u0010, V,\u0003L),\none could use the Buckingham pi theorem to obtain Equation 6.50. However, having begun\nwith the differential form of the conservation equations, we have eliminated the guesswork\nand have established the similarity parameters in a rigorous fashion.\nThe importance of an expression such as Equation 6.50 should be fully appreciated. It\nstates that values of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient , whether obtained theoretically,\nexperimentally, or numerically, can be completely represented in terms of only three dimen-\nsionless groups, instead of the original seven dimensional parameters. The convenience and\npower afforded by such simpliﬁcation will become evident in Chapters 7 through 10. More-\nover, once the form of the functional dependence of Equation 6.50 has been obtained for a\nparticular surface geometry, let us say from laboratory measurements, it is known to be uni-\nversallyapplicable. By this we mean that it may be applied for different ﬂuids, velocities,\nand length scales, as long as the assumptions implicit in the originating boundary layer equa-\ntions remain valid (e.g., negligible viscous dissipation and body forces).\nEXAMPLE6.5\nExperimental tests using air as the working ﬂuid are conducted on a portion of the turbine\nblade shown in the sketch.

Consider the Reynolds\u0003number ReL(Equation\n6.41), which may be interpreted as the ratio\u0003of\u0003inertia\u0003to\u0003viscous\u0003forcesin a region of char-\nacteristic dimension L. Inertia forces are associated with an increase in the momentum of a\nmoving ﬂuid. From Equation 6.28, it is evident that these forces (per unit mass) are of the\nform , in which case an order-of-magnitude approximation gives FI\rV2/L. Simi-\nlarly, the net shear force (per unit mass) is found on the right-hand side of Equation 6.28 as\n\u0011( ) and may be approximated as Fs\r\u0011V/L2. Therefore, the ratio of forces is\nWe therefore expect inertia forces to dominate for large values of ReLand viscous forces to\ndominate for small values of ReL.\nThere are several important implications of this result. Recall from Section 6.3.1 that\nthe Reynolds number determines the existence of laminar or turbulent ﬂow. We should also\nexpect the magnitude of the Reynolds number to inﬂuence the velocity boundary layer\nthickness \t. With increasing ReLat a ﬁxed location on a surface, we expect viscous forces\nto become less inﬂuential relative to inertia forces. Hence the effects of viscosity do not\npenetrate as far into the free stream, and the value of \t diminishes.\nThe Prandtl\u0003numberis deﬁned as the ratio of the kinematic viscosity, also referred to\nas the momentum diffusivity, \u0011, to the thermal diffusivity \u0006. It is therefore a ﬂuid property.\nThe Prandtl number provides a measure\u0003of\u0003the\u0003relative\u0003effectiveness \u0003of\u0003momentum \u0003and\nenergy\u0003transport\u0003by\u0003diffusion\u0003in\u0003the\u0003velocity\u0003and\u0003thermal\u0003boundary \u0003layers, respectively.\nFrom Table A.4 we see that the Prandtl number of gases is near unity, in which case energy\nand momentum transfer by diffusion are comparable. In a liquid metal (Table A.7), Pr\u00021\nand the energy diffusion rate greatly exceeds the momentum diffusion rate. The opposite is\ntrue for oils (Table A.5), for which Pr\u0003\u00161. From this interpretation it follows that the value\nof Prstrongly inﬂuences the relative growth of the velocity and thermal boundary layers. In\nfact for laminar boundary layers (in which transport by diffusion is notovershadowed by\nturbulent mixing), it is reasonable to expect that\n(6.55)\nwhere nis a positive exponent. Hence for a gas \tt\r\t; for a liquid metal \tt\u0016\t; for an oil\n\tt\u0002\t.\nSimilarly, the Schmidt\u0003number,which is deﬁned in Equation 6.43, is a ﬂuid property\nand provides a\u0003measure\u0003of\u0003the\u0003relative\u0003effectiveness \u0003of\u0003momentum \u0003and\u0003mass\u0003transport\u0003by\ndiffusion\u0003in\u0003the\u0003velocity\u0003and\u0003concentration \u0003boundary \u0003layers, respectively.

The list includes groups already considered, as well as those yet to be introduced for\nspecial conditions. As a new group is confronted, its deﬁnition and interpretation should be\ncommitted to memory. Note that the Grashof\u0003numberprovides a measure of the ratio of\nbuoyancy forces to viscous forces in the velocity boundary layer. Its role in free convection\n(Chapter 9) is much the same as that of the Reynolds number in forced convection. The\nEckert\u0003numberprovides a measure of the kinetic energy of the ﬂow relative to the enthalpy\ndifference across the thermal boundary layer. It plays an important role in high-speed ﬂows\nfor which viscous dissipation is signiﬁcant. Note also that, although similar in form, the\nNusselt and Biot numbers differ in both deﬁnition and interpretation. Whereas the Nusselt\nnumber is deﬁned in terms of the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid, the Biot number is\nbased on the solid thermal conductivity, Equation 5.9.\tt\n\tc \u001a LenLe\u000f\u0006\nDAB\u000fSc\nPrTABLE6.2Continued\nGroup Definitio Interpretation\nGrashof number Measure of the ratio of buoyancy forces to viscous forces\n(GrL)\nColburn jfactor Dimensionless heat transfer coefﬁcient\n(jH)\nColburn jfactor Dimensionless mass transfer coefﬁcient\n(jm)\nJakob number Ratio of sensible to latent energy absorbed during \n(Ja) liquid–vapor phase change\nLewis number Ratio of the thermal and mass diffusivities\n(Le)\nMach number Ratio of velocity to speed of sound\n(Ma)\nNusselt number Ratio of convection to pure conduction heat transfer\n(NuL)\nPeclet number Ratio of advection to conduction heat transfer rates\n(PeL)\nPrandtl number Ratio of the momentum and thermal diffusivities\n(Pr)\nReynolds number Ratio of the inertia and viscous forces\n(ReL)\nSchmidt number Ratio of the momentum and mass diffusivities\n(Sc)\nSherwood number Dimensionless concentration gradient at the surface\n(ShL)\nStanton number Modiﬁed Nusselt number\n(St)\nMass transfer Modiﬁed Sherwood number\nStanton number\n(Stm)\nWeber number Ratio of inertia to surface tension forces\n(We)St Pr2/3\nStmSc2/3\n\u0013V2L\n\u0014hm\nV \u000f ShL\nReL     Sch\n\u0013Vcp \u000f NuL\nReL PrhmL\nDAB\u0011\nDABVL\n\u0011cp\u0010\nk\u000f\u0011\n\u0006VL\n\u0006\u000fReL  PrhL\nkfV\na\u0006\nDABcp(Ts\fTsat)\nhfgg\u0007(Ts\fT\u0003)L3\n\u00112\n6.7Boundary Layer Analogies\nAs engineers, our interest in boundary layer behavior is directed principally toward the\ndimensionless parameters Cf, Nu, and Sh. From knowledge of these parameters, we may\ncompute the wall shear stress and the convection heat and mass transfer rates. It is there-\nfore understandable that expressions that relate Cf, Nu, and Shto each other can be useful\ntools in convection analysis. Such expressions are available in the form of boundary \u0003layer\nanalogies.6.7 \u0004Boundary Layer Analogies 409410 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n6.7.1The Heat and Mass Transfer Analogy\nIf two or more processes are governed by dimensionless equations of the same form, the\nprocesses are said to be analogous. Clearly, then, from Equations 6.36 and 6.37 and the\nboundary conditions, Equations 6.39 and 6.40, of Table 6.1, convection heat and mass\ntransfer are analogous. Each of the differential equations is composed of advection and dif-\nfusion terms of the same form. Moreover, as shown in Equations 6.36 and 6.37, each equa-\ntion is related to the velocity ﬁeld through ReL, and the parameters Prand Scassume\nanalogous roles. One implication of this analogy is that dimensionless relations that govern\nthermal boundary layer behavior must be of the same form as those that govern the concen-\ntration boundary layer. Hence the boundary layer temperature and concentration proﬁles\nmust also be of the same functional form if the applied boundary conditions are analogous.\nRecalling the discussion of Section 6.5.2, the features of which are summarized in\nTable 6.3, an important result of the heat and mass transfer analogy may be obtained. From\nthe foregoing paragraph, it follows that Equation 6.47 must be of the same functional form\nas Equation 6.51. From Equations 6.48 and 6.52, it then follows that the dimensionless\ntemperature and concentration gradients evaluated at the surface, and therefore the values\nof Nuand Sh, are analogous. Similarly, expressions for the average Nusselt and Sherwood\nnumbers, Equations 6.50 and 6.54, respectively, are also of the same form. Accordingly,\nheat\u0003and\u0003mass\u0003transfer\u0003relations\u0003for\u0003a\u0003particular \u0003geometry\u0003are\u0003interchangeable. If, for\nexample, one has performed a set of heat transfer experiments to determine the functional\nform of Equation 6.49 for a particular surface geometry, the results may be used for con-\nvection mass transfer involving the same geometry, simply by replacing Nuwith Shand Pr\nwith Sc.\nThe analogy may also be used to directly relate the two convection coefﬁcients. In sub-\nsequent chapters we will ﬁnd that Nuand Share generally proportional to Prnand Scn,\nrespectively, where nis a positive exponent less than 1.

The same relation may be applied to the average\ncoefﬁcients h–and h–\nm, and it may be used in turbulent, as well as laminar, ﬂow. For most\napplications it is reasonable to assume a value of n\u000f.\nEXAMPLE6.7 \nA solid of arbitrary shape is suspended in atmospheric air having a free stream temperature\nand velocity of 20 \u0011C and 100m/s, respectively. The solid has a characteristic length of 1m,\nand its surface is maintained at 80 \u0011C. Under these conditions measurements of the convec-\ntion heat ﬂux at a particular point ( x*) on the surface and of the temperature in the bound-\nary layer above this point ( x*, y*) reveal values of 104W/m2and 60\u0011C, respectively.

Evaporation\noccurs from the liquid surface, and the energy associated with the phase change is the latent\nheat of vaporization of the liquid. Evaporation occurs when liquid molecules near the sur-\nface experience collisions that increase their energy above that needed to overcome the\nsurface binding energy. The energy required to sustain the evaporation must come from the\ninternal energy of the liquid, which would then experience a reduction in temperature (the\ncooling effect). However, if steady-state conditions are to be maintained, the latent energy\nlost by the liquid because of evaporation must be replenished by energy transfer to the liq-\nuid from its surroundings. Neglecting radiation effects, this transfer may be due to the con-\nvection of sensible energy from the gas or to heat addition by other means, as, for example,\nby an electrical heater submerged in the liquid. Applying conservation of energy to a con-\ntrol surface about the liquid (Equation 1.12c), it follows that, for a unit surface area,\n(6.61) q\nconv\u000bq\nadd\u000fq\nevapN\nA(x*)\u000f3.54\r10\f4\n kmol/s\u0003m2N\nA(x*)\u000f0.077  m/s (0.0046 \f0.0)  kmol/m3 hm\u000f0.077  m/s hm\u000fL1\nL2\rDAB\nk\rq\n(Ts\fT\u0003)\u000f 1\n2\r0.26\r10\f4\n m2/s\n0.028  W/m\u0003K\r104\n W/m2\n(80\f20)\u0011CSh\u000fhmL2\nDAB\u000fNu\u000fhL1\nkx*1\u000fx*2N\nA(x*)\u000fhm(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)CA(x*, y*)\u000f0.67 (0.0046  kmol/m3)\u000f0.0031  kmol/m36.7 \u0004Boundary Layer Analogies 413where may be approximated as the product of the evaporative mass ﬂux and the latent\nheat of vaporization\n(6.62)\nIf there is no heat addition by other means, Equation 6.61 reduces to a balance between\nconvection heat transfer from the gas and the evaporative heat loss from the liquid.

For a ﬂat plate parallel to the incoming ﬂow, we have\ndp*/dx*\u000f0 and there is no variation in the free stream velocity outside the boundary\nlayer. With u\u0003\u000fV, Equations 6.38 through 6.40 also have the same form. Hence the func-\ntional forms of the solutions for u*, T*, and C*A, Equations 6.44, 6.47, and 6.51, must be\nequivalent. From Equations 6.45, 6.48, and 6.52, it follows that\n(6.66)\nReplacing Nuand Shby the Stanton\u0003number(St) and the mass\u0003transfer\u0003Stanton\u0003number\n(Stm), respectively,\n(6.67)\n(6.68)\nEquation 6.66 may also be expressed in the form\n(6.69)\nEquation 6.69 is known as the Reynolds analogy, and it relates the key engineer-\ning parameters of the velocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers. If the\nvelocity parameter is known, the analogy may be used to obtain the other parameters,\nand vice versa. However, there are restrictions associated with using this result. In\naddition to relying on the validity of the boundary layer approximations, the accuracy\nof Equation 6.69 depends on having PrandSc1 anddp*/dx* 0.

For lami-\nnar ﬂow Equations 6.70 and 6.71 are only appropriate when dp*/dx*\u00070, but in turbulent\nﬂow, conditions are less sensitive to the effect of pressure gradients and these equations\nremain approximately valid. If the analogy is applicable at every point on a surface, it may\nbe applied to the surface average coefﬁcients.\n6.8Summary\nIn this chapter we have considered several fundamental issues related to convection trans-\nport phenomena. In the process, however, you should not lose sight of what remains the\nproblem\u0003of\u0003convection. Our primary objective is still one of developing means to determine\nthe convection coefﬁcients hand hm. Although these coefﬁcients may be obtained by solv-\ning the boundary layer equations, it is only for simple ﬂow situations that such solutions are\nreadily effected. The more practical approach frequently involves calculating hand hmfrom\nempirical relations of the form given by Equations 6.49 and 6.53. The particular form of\nthese equations is obtained by correlating measured convection heat and mass transfer\nresults in terms of appropriate dimensionless groups. It is this approach that is emphasized\nin the chapters that follow.\nTo test your comprehension of the material, you should challenge yourself with appro-\npriate questions.\n• What is the difference between a localconvection heat transfer coefﬁcient and an aver-\nagecoefﬁcient?

In\nSection 1.2.2 we used the term convection to describe energy transfer between a surface and\na ﬂuid moving over the surface. Convection includes energy transfer by both the bulk ﬂuid\nmotion (advection) and the random motion of ﬂuid molecules (conduction or diffusion).\nIn our treatment of convection, we have two major objectives. In addition to obtaining\nan understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie convection transfer, we wish\nto develop the means to perform convection transfer calculations. This chapter and the\nmaterial of Appendix E are devoted primarily to achieving the former objective. Physical\norigins are discussed, and relevant dimensionless parameters, as well as important analo-\ngies, are developed.\nA unique feature of this chapter is the manner in which convection mass transfer effects\nare introduced by analogy to those of convection heat transfer. In mass transfer by convec-\ntion, gross ﬂuid motion combines with diffusion to promote the transfer of a species for\nwhich there exists a concentration gradient. In this text, we focus on convection mass transfer\nthat occurs at the surface of a volatile solid or liquid due to motion of a gas over the surface.\nWith conceptual foundations established, subsequent chapters are used to develop\nuseful tools for quantifying convection effects. Chapters 7 and 8 present methods for com-\nputing the coefﬁcients associated with forced convection in external and internal ﬂow con-\nﬁgurations, respectively. Chapter 9 describes methods for determining these coefﬁcients in\nfree convection, and Chapter 10 considers the problem of convection with phase change\n(boiling and condensation). Chapter 11 develops methods for designing and evaluating the\nperformance of heat exchangers, devices that are widely used in engineering practice to\neffect heat transfer between ﬂuids.\nAccordingly, we begin by developing our understanding of the nature of convection.\n6.1The Convection Boundary Layers\nThe concept of boundary layers is central to the understanding of convection heat and\nmass transfer between a surface and a ﬂuid ﬂowing past it. In this section, velocity,\nthermal, and concentration boundary layers are described, and their relationships to the\nfriction coefﬁcient, convection heat transfer coefﬁcient, and convection mass transfer\ncoefﬁcient are introduced.\n6.1.1The Velocity Boundary Layer\nTo introduce the concept of a boundary layer, consider ﬂow over the ﬂat plate of \nFigure 6.1. When ﬂuid particles make contact with the surface, their velocity is reduced\nsigniﬁcantly relative to the ﬂuid velocity upstream of the plate, and for most situations it is\nvalid to assume that the particle velocity is zero at the wall.1These particles then act to\n1This is an approximation of the situation discussed in Section 3.9, wherein ﬂuid molecules or particles continu-\nally collide with and are reﬂected from the surface. The momentum of an individual ﬂuid particle will change in\nresponse to its collision with the surface. This effect may be described by momentum \u0003accommodation \u0003coeffi\ncients, as will be discussed in Section 8.8. In this chapter, we assume that nano- and microscale effects are not\nimportant, in which case the assumption of zero ﬂuid velocity at the wall is valid.retard the motion of particles in the adjoining ﬂuid layer, which act to retard the motion of\nparticles in the next layer, and so on until, at a distance y\u000f\tfrom the surface, the effect\nbecomes negligible. This retardation of ﬂuid motion is associated with shear\u0003stresses\u0015 acting\nin planes that are parallel to the ﬂuid velocity (Figure 6.1). With increasing distance yfrom\nthe surface, the xvelocity component of the ﬂuid, u, must then increase until it approaches the\nfree stream value u\u0003. The subscript \u0003is used to designate conditions in the free stream out-\nside the boundary layer.\nThe quantity \tis termed the boundary \u0003layer\u0003thickness, and it is typically deﬁned as the\nvalue of yfor which u\u000f0.99u\u0003. The boundary \u0003layer\u0003velocity\u0003profilrefers to the manner\nin which uvaries with ythrough the boundary layer. Accordingly, the ﬂuid ﬂow is charac-\nterized by two distinct regions, a thin ﬂuid layer (the boundary layer) in which velocity gra-\ndients and shear stresses are large and a region outside the boundary layer in which velocity\ngradients and shear stresses are negligible. With increasing distance from the leading edge,\nthe effects of viscosity penetrate farther into the free stream and the boundary layer grows\n(\tincreases with x).\nBecause it pertains to the ﬂuid velocity, the foregoing boundary layer may be referred\nto more speciﬁcally as the velocity\u0003boundary \u0003layer. It develops whenever there is ﬂuid ﬂow\nover a surface, and it is of fundamental importance to problems involving convection trans-\nport. In ﬂuid mechanics its signiﬁcance to the engineer stems from its relation to the sur-\nface shear stress \u0015s, and hence to surface frictional effects. For external ﬂows it provides the\nbasis for determining the local friction\u0003coefficien\n(6.1)\na key dimensionless parameter from which the surface frictional drag may be determined.\nAssuming a Newtonian \u0003flui, the surface shear stress may be evaluated from knowledge of\nthe velocity gradient at the surface\n(6.2)\nwhere \u0010 is a ﬂuid property known as the dynamic\u0003viscosity. In a velocity boundary layer,\nthe velocity gradient at the surface depends on the distance xfrom the leading edge of the\nplate. Therefore, the surface shear stress and friction coefﬁcient also depend on x.\n6.1.2The Thermal Boundary Layer\nJust as a velocity boundary layer develops when there is ﬂuid ﬂow over a surface, a thermal\nboundary \u0003layermust develop if the ﬂuid free stream and surface temperatures differ. Con-\nsider ﬂow over an isothermal ﬂat plate (Figure 6.2).

However, ﬂuid particles that come into contact with the\nplate achieve thermal equilibrium at the plate’s surface temperature.2In turn, these particles\nexchange energy with those in the adjoining ﬂuid layer, and temperature gradients develop\nin the ﬂuid. The region of the ﬂuid in which these temperature gradients exist is the thermal\nboundary layer, and its thickness \ttis typically deﬁned as the value of yfor which the ratio\n[(Ts\fT)/(Ts\fT\u0003)]\u000f0.99. With increasing distance from the leading edge, the effects of\nheat transfer penetrate farther into the free stream and the thermal boundary layer grows.\nThe relation between conditions in this boundary layer and the convection heat transfer\ncoefﬁcient may readily be demonstrated. At any distance xfrom the leading edge, the local\nsurface heat ﬂux may be obtained by applying Fourier’s law to the fluiat y\u000f0. That is,\n(6.3)\nThe subscript shas been used to emphasize that this is the surface heat ﬂux, but it will be\ndropped in later sections. This expression is appropriate because, at\u0003the\u0003surface,\u0003there\u0003is\u0003no\nfluidmotion \u0003and\u0003energy\u0003transfer\u0003occurs\u0003only\u0003by\u0003conduction . Recalling Newton’s law of\ncooling, we see that\n(6.4)\nand combining this with Equation 6.3, we obtain\n(6.5)\nHence, conditions in the thermal boundary layer, which strongly inﬂuence the wall tem-\nperature gradient \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0, determine the rate of heat transfer across the boundary layer.\nSince is a constant, independent of x, while increases with increasing x, \ntemperature gradients in the boundary layer must decrease with increasing x. Accordingly,\nthe magnitude of decreases with increasing x, and it follows that and h\ndecrease with increasing x.\n6.1.3The Concentration Boundary Layer\nWhen air moves past the surface of a pool of water, the liquid water will evaporate, and\nwater vapor will be transferred into the airstream. This is an example of convection mass\ntransfer. More generally, consider a binary\u0003mixtureof chemical species A and B that ﬂowsq\ns \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0\tt (Ts\fT\u0003)h\u000f\fkf \u001dT/\u001dy\u0016y\u000f0\nTs\fT\u0003q\ns\u000fh(Ts\fT\u0003)q\ns\u000f\fkf  \u001dT\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0380 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\nT∞\ny\nxT∞Free stream\nThermal\nboundary\nlayert(x)δ\nTsδt\u0003u∞\nT\nFIGURE6.2Thermal boundary layer \ndevelopment on an isothermal ﬂat plate.\n2Micro- and nanoscale effects are assumed to be negligible in this chapter. Hence, the thermal accommodation\ncoefﬁcient of Section 3.9 attains a value of unity, in which case the ﬂuid particles achieve thermal equilibrium\nwith the surface of the plate. Micro- and nanoscale effects will be discussed in Section 8.8.over a surface (Figure 6.3). The molar concentration (kmol/m3) of species A at the surface is\nCA,s, and in the free stream it is CA,\u0003. If CA,sdiffers from CA,\u0003, transfer of species A by con-\nvection will occur. For example, species A could be a vapor that is transferred into a gas\nstream (species B) due to evaporation at a liquid surface (as in the water example) or due to\nsublimation at a solid surface. In this situation, a concentration \u0003boundary \u0003layerwill develop\nthat is similar to the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The concentration boundary layer\nis the region of the ﬂuid in which concentration gradients exist, and its thickness \tcis typi-\ncally deﬁned as the value of yfor which [( CA,s\fCA)/(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)]\u000f0.99. With increasing\ndistance from the leading edge, the effects of species transfer penetrate farther into the free\nstream and the concentration boundary layer grows.\nSpecies transfer by convection between the surface and the free stream ﬂuid is deter-\nmined by conditions in the boundary layer, and we are interested in determining the rate at\nwhich this transfer occurs. In particular, we are interested in the molar ﬂux of species A, \n(kmol/s\u0003m2). It is helpful to recognize that the molar ﬂux associated with species transfer by\ndiffusion is determined by an expression that is analogous to Fourier’s law. For the condi-\ntions of interest in this chapter, the expression, which is termed , has the form\n(6.6)3\nwhere DABis a property of the binary mixture known as the binary\u0003diffusion\u0003coefficien . At\nany point corresponding to y\b0 in the concentration boundary layer of Figure 6.3, species\ntransfer is due to both bulk ﬂuid motion ( advection ) and diffusion. However, absent nano-\nor microscale effects and the inﬂuence of species diffusion on the velocity normal to the\nsurface, ﬂuid motion at the surface can be neglected.4Accordingly, species transfer at \nthe surface is only by diffusion, and applying Fick’s law at y\u000f0, the molar ﬂux is \n(6.7)\nThe subscript shas been used to emphasize that this is the molar ﬂux at the surface, but it will\nbe dropped in later sections. Analogous to Newton’s law of cooling, an equation can be writ-\nten that relates the molar ﬂux to the concentration difference across the boundary layer, as\n(6.8) N\nA,s\u000fhm(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)N\nA,s\u000f \fDAB \u001dCA\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0N\nA\u000f \fDAB \u001dCA\n\u001dyN\nA6.1 \u0004The Convection Boundary Layers 381\n3This expression is an approximation of a more general form of Fick’s law of diffusion (Section 14.1.3) when the\ntotal molar concentration of the mixture, C\u000fCA\u000bCB, is a constant.\n4The basis for neglecting the effects of diffusion on bulk ﬂuid motion is considered in Sections 14.2 and 14.3.CA,sδcu∞\nMixture\nof A + B\nCA,∞\ny\nxCA,∞ Free streamδc\u0003(x)\nConcentration\nboundary\nlayerCA\nFIGURE6.3Species concentration boundary\nlayer development on a ﬂat plate.where hm(m/s) is the convection \u0003mass\u0003transfer\u0003coefficien , analogous to the convection heat\ntransfer coefﬁcient. Combining Equations 6.7 and 6.8, it follows that\n(6.9)\nTherefore, conditions in the concentration boundary layer, which strongly inﬂuence the\nsurface concentration gradient , also inﬂuence the convection mass transfer coef-\nﬁcient and hence the rate of species transfer in the boundary layer.\n6.1.4Signiﬁcance of the Boundary Layers\nFor ﬂow over any surface, there will always exist a velocity boundary layer and hence sur-\nface friction. Likewise, a thermal boundary layer, and hence convection heat transfer, will\nalways exist if the surface and free stream temperatures differ. Similarly, a concentration\nboundary layer and convection mass transfer will exist if the ﬂuid’s species concentration\nat the surface differs from its species concentration in the free stream. The velocity bound-\nary layer is of extent \t(x) and is characterized by the presence of velocity gradients and\nshear stresses. The thermal boundary layer is of extent \tt(x) and is characterized by temper-\nature gradients and heat transfer. Finally, the concentration boundary layer is of extent \tc(x)\nand is characterized by concentration gradients and species transfer. Situations can arise in\nwhich all three boundary layers are present. In such cases, the boundary layers rarely grow\nat the same rate, and the values of \t, \tt, and \tcat a given location are not the same.\nFor the engineer, the principal manifestations of the three boundary layers are, respec-\ntively, surface\u0003friction, convection \u0003heat\u0003transfer, and convection \u0003mass\u0003transfer. The key\nboundary layer parameters are then the friction\u0003coefficienCfand the heatand mass\u0003transfer\nconvection \u0003coefficientsh and hm, respectively. We now turn our attention to examining\nthese key parameters, which are central to the analysis of convection heat and mass transfer\nproblems.\n6.2Local and Average Convection Coefﬁcients\n6.2.1Heat Transfer\nConsider the conditions of Figure 6.4 a. A ﬂuid of velocity Vand temperature T\u0003ﬂows over\na surface of arbitrary shape and of area As. The surface is presumed to be at a uniform \ntemperature, Ts, and if Ts&T\u0003, we know that convection heat transfer will occur. From\nSection 6.1.2, we also know that the surface heat ﬂux and convection heat transfer coefﬁ-\ncient both vary along the surface. The total\u0003heat\u0003transfer\u0003rate\u0003qmay be obtained by inte-\ngrating the local ﬂux over the entire surface.

Such a determination may be made by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at\nthe interface between the gas and the liquid or solid phase. One implication of equilibrium\nis that the temperature of the vapor at the interface is equal to the surface temperature Ts. A\nsecond implication is that the vapor is in a saturated \u0003state, in which case thermodynamic\ntables, such as Table A.6 for water, may be used to obtain its density from knowledge of Ts.\nTo a good approximation, the molar concentration of the vapor at the surface may also be\ndetermined from the vapor pressure through application of the equation of state for an ideal\ngas.

A review of the different ways in which driving potentials, ﬂuxes, and convection coefﬁcients may\nbe formulated is provided by Webb [1].where \u0003 is the universal gas constant and psat(Ts) is the vapor pressure corresponding to\nsaturation at Ts.

These quantities may be determined from the rate equations, Equations\n6.4, 6.8, 6.12, and 6.15, which depend on knowledge of the local ( horhm) and average\n( or ) convection coefficients. It is for this reason that determination of these coeffi-\ncients is viewed as the problem of convection . However, the problem is not a simple\none, for in addition to depending on numerous fluid properties such as density, viscos-\nity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat, the coefficients depend on the surface\ngeometry and theflow conditions . This multiplicity of independent variables is attribut-\nable to the dependence of convection transfer on the boundary layers that develop on\nthe surface.\nEXAMPLE6.1\nExperimental results for the local heat transfer coefﬁcient hxfor ﬂow over a ﬂat plate with\nan extremely rough surface were found to ﬁt the relation\nwhere ais a coefﬁcient (W/m1.9\u0003K) and x\u0003(m) is the distance from the leading edge of \nthe plate.\n1.Develop an expression for the ratio of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient xfor a\nplate of length xto the local heat transfer coefﬁcient hxat x.\n2.Plot the variation of hxand xas a function of x.\nSOLUTION\nKnown: Variation of the local heat transfer coefﬁcient, hx(x).\nFind:\n1.The ratio of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient ( x) to the local value hx(x).\n2.Plot of the variation of hxand xwith x.\nSchematic:\nxT∞\nTs\u0007t(x)Boundary layer\nhx = ax–0.1hhhhhx(x)\u000fax\f0.1hmh6.2 \u0004Local and Average Convection Coefﬁcients 385Analysis:\n1.From Equation 6.14 the average value of the convection heat transfer coefﬁcient over\nthe region from 0 to xis\nSubstituting the expression for the local heat transfer coefﬁcient\nand integrating, we obtain\nor\n\u0005\n2.The variation of hxand xwith xis as follows:\nComments: Boundary layer development causes both the local and average coefﬁcients\nto decrease with increasing distance from the leading edge.

An essential step in the treatment of any convection problem is to determine\nwhether the boundary layer is laminaror turbulent. Surface friction and the convection\ntransfer rates depend strongly on which of these conditions exists.\n6.3.1Laminar and Turbulent Velocity Boundary Layers\nBoundary layer development on a ﬂat plate is illustrated in Figure 6.6. In many cases, lami-\nnar and turbulent ﬂow conditions both occur, with the laminar section preceding the turbu-\nlent section. For either condition, the ﬂuid motion is characterized by velocity components\nin the x- and y-directions. Fluid motion away from the surface is necessitated by the slowing\nof the ﬂuid near the wall as the boundary layer grows in the x-direction. Figure 6.6 shows\nthat there are sharp differences between laminar and turbulent ﬂow conditions, as described\nin the following paragraphs.\nIn the laminar boundary layer, the ﬂuid ﬂow is highly ordered and it is possible to iden-\ntify streamlines along which ﬂuid particles move. From Section 6.1.1 we know that the\nboundary layer thickness grows and that velocity gradients at y\u000f0 decrease in the stream-\nwise (increasing x) direction. From Equation 6.2, we see that the local surface shear stress\n\u0015salso decreases with increasing x. The highly ordered behavior continues until a transition\nzone is reached, across which a conversion from laminar to turbulent conditions occurs.\nConditions within the transition zone change with time, with the ﬂow sometimes exhibiting\nlaminar behavior and sometimes exhibiting the characteristics of turbulent ﬂow.\nFlow in the fully turbulent boundary layer is, in general, highly irregular and is charac-\nterized by random, three-dimensional motion of relatively large parcels of ﬂuid. Mixing\nwithin the boundary layer carries high-speed ﬂuid toward the solid surface and transfers\nslower-moving ﬂuid farther into the free stream. Much of the mixing is promoted by\nstreamwise vortices called streaksthat are generated intermittently near the ﬂat plate,\nwhere they rapidly grow and decay. Recent analytical and experimental studies have sug-\ngested that these and other coherent\u0003structures within the turbulent ﬂow can travel in waves\nat velocities that can exceed u\u0003, interact nonlinearly, and spawn the chaotic conditions that\ncharacterize turbulent ﬂow [2].6.3 \u0004Laminar and Turbulent Flow 389\nFIGURE6.6Velocity boundary layer development on a ﬂat plate.Viscous\nsublayerBuffer layerTurbulent\nregionu∞\nu∞Streamline\nv\nu\nx, uy, v\nu∞\nxc\nLaminarx\nTransitionTurbulentAs a result of the interactions that lead to chaotic ﬂow conditions, velocity and pressure\nﬂuctuations occur at any point within the turbulent boundary layer. Three different regions\nmay be delineated within the turbulent boundary layer as a function of distance from the sur-\nface. We may speak of a viscous\u0003sublayerin which transport is dominated by diffusion and the\nvelocity proﬁle is nearly linear. There is an adjoining buffer\u0003layerin which diffusion and turbu-\nlent mixing are comparable, and there is a turbulent\u0003zonein which transport is dominated by\nturbulent mixing. A comparison of the laminar and turbulent boundary layer proﬁles for the \nx-component of the velocity, provided in Figure 6.7, shows that the turbulent velocity proﬁle is\nrelatively ﬂat due to the mixing that occurs within the buffer layer and turbulent region, giving\nrise to large velocity gradients within the viscous sublayer. Hence, \u0015sis generally larger in the\nturbulent portion of the boundary layer of Figure6.6 than in the laminar portion.\nThe transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow is ultimately due to triggering \u0003mecha-\nnisms, such as the interaction of unsteady ﬂow structures that develop naturally within the\nﬂuid or small disturbances that exist within many typical boundary layers. These distur-\nbances may originate from ﬂuctuations in the free stream, or they may be induced by sur-\nface roughness or minute surface vibrations. The onset of turbulence depends on whether\nthe triggering mechanisms are ampliﬁed or attenuated in the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow, which\nin turn depends on a dimensionless grouping of parameters called the Reynolds\u0003number,\n(6.23)\nwhere, for a ﬂat plate, the characteristic length is x, the distance from the leading edge. It\nwill be shown later that the Reynolds number represents the ratio of the inertia to viscous\nforces. If the Reynolds number is small, inertia forces are insigniﬁcant relative to viscous forces.\nThe disturbances are then dissipated, and the ﬂow remains laminar. For a large Reynolds\nnumber, however, the inertia forces can be sufﬁcient to amplify the triggering mechanisms,\nand a transition to turbulence occurs.\nIn determining whether the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent, it is frequently rea-\nsonable to assume that transition begins at some location xc, as shown in Figure 6.6. This\nlocation is determined by the criticalReynolds number, Rex,c. For ﬂow over a ﬂat plate,\nRex,cis known to vary from approximately 105to 3\r106, depending on surface roughness\nand the turbulence level of the free stream. A representative value of\n(6.24)\nis often assumed for boundary layer calculations and, unless otherwise noted, is used for\nthe calculations of this text that involve a ﬂat plate.Rex,c \f \u0013u\u0003xc\n\u0010\u000f5\r105Rex\u000f\u0013u\u0003 x\n\u0010390 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n6Since velocity ﬂuctuates with time in turbulent ﬂow, the time-averaged velocity, , is plotted in Figure 6.7. uy\u0003= 0y\u0003= 0u(y) u_(y)u∞ u∞\nLaminar Turbulentu\nyy\u0003= 0, lam y\u0003= 0, turb<u\ny\nu\nyu\ny\nFIGURE6.7Comparison of laminar and\nturbulent velocity boundary layer proﬁles\nfor the same free stream velocity.66.3.2Laminar and Turbulent Thermal and Species \nConcentration Boundary Layers\nSince the velocity distribution determines the advective component of thermal energy or\nchemical species transfer within the boundary layer, the nature of the ﬂow also has a pro-\nfound effect on convective heat and mass transfer rates. Similar to the laminar velocity\nboundary layer, the thermal and species boundary layers grow in the streamwise (increas-\ning x) direction, temperature and species concentration gradients in the ﬂuid at y\u000f0\ndecrease in the streamwise direction, and, from Equations 6.5 and 6.9, the heat and mass\ntransfer coefﬁcients also decrease with increasing x.\nJust as it induces large velocity gradients at y\u000f0, as shown in Figure 6.7, turbulent\nmixing promotes large temperature and species concentration gradients adjacent to the solid\nsurface as well as a corresponding increase in the heat and mass transfer coefﬁcients across\nthe transition region. These effects are illustrated in Figure 6.8 for the velocity boundary\nlayer thickness \tand the local convection heat transfer coefﬁcient h. Because turbulence\ninduces mixing, which in turn reduces the importance of conduction and diffusion in deter-\nmining the thermal and species boundary layer thicknesses, differences in the thicknesses of\nthe velocity, thermal, and species boundary layers tend to be much smaller in turbulent ﬂow\nthan in laminar ﬂow. As is evident in Equation 6.24, the presence of heat and/or mass trans-\nfer can affect the location of the transition from laminar to turbulent ﬂow xcsince the density\nand dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid can depend on the temperature or species concentration.\nEXAMPLE6.4\nWater ﬂows at a velocity u\u0003\u000f1m/s over a ﬂat plate of length L\u000f0.6m.

The\nﬂuid is considered to be a binary mixture of species A and B, and the concentration bound-\nary layer originates from a difference between the free stream and surface concentrations\n(CA,\u0003&CA,s). Illustration of the relative thicknesses ( \tt\b\tc\b\t) in Figure 6.9 is arbitrary,\nfor the moment, and the factors that inﬂuence relative boundary layer development are dis-\ncussed later in this chapter.\nOur objective in this section is to examine the differential equations that govern the\nvelocity, temperature, and species concentration ﬁelds that are applicable to boundary layer\nﬂow with heat and species transfer. Section 6.4.1 presents the laminar boundary layer equa-\ntions, and Appendix F gives the corresponding equations for turbulent conditions. In\nSection 6.5, these equations will be used to determine important dimensionless parameters\nassociated with convection that will be used extensively in subsequent chapters. \n6.4.1Boundary Layer Equations for Laminar Flow\nMotion of a ﬂuid in which there are coexisting velocity, temperature, and concentration\ngradients must comply with several fundamental \u0003laws\u0003of\u0003nature. In particular, at each point\nin the ﬂuid, conservation \u0003of\u0003mass, energy, and chemical\u0003species, as well as sec-\nond\u0003law\u0003of\u0003motion, must be satisﬁed. Equations representing these requirements are derived\nby applying the laws to a differential control volume situated in the ﬂow. The resulting\nequations, in Cartesian coordinates, for the steady, two-dimensional \u0003floof an incompress-\nible\u0003fluiwith constant\u0003properties are given in Appendix E. These equations serve as\nstarting points for our analysis of laminar boundary layers. Note that turbulent ﬂows are\ninherently unsteady, and the equations governing them are presented in Appendix F. 394 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\nMixture\nof A + Bxyu∞\ns\nδ\nVelocity\nboundary\nlayerCA,∞  \nCA,s\nδ\nConcentration\nboundary\nlayerc\nCA,∞VT∞dy\ndxN\"A,s\nq\"s\nTs\nδ\nThermal\nboundary\nlayertT∞\nτ\nFIGURE6.9Development of the velocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers for an\narbitrary surface.\nThese\u0003equations \u0003are\u0003derived\u0003in\u0003Section\u00036S.1.We begin by restricting attention to applications for which body\u0003forces\u0003are\u0003negligible\n(X\u000fY\u000f0 in Equations E.2 and E.3), there is no\u0003thermal\u0003energy\u0003generation \u0003in\u0003the\u0003flui\n( in Equation E.4), and the flow is\u0003nonreacting (\u000f0 in Equation E.6). Additional\nsimpliﬁcations may be made by invoking approximations pertinent to conditions in the\nvelocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers. The boundary layer thicknesses are\ntypically very small relative to the size of the object upon which they form, and the x-direction\nvelocity, temperature, and concentration must change from their surface to their free stream\nvalues over these very small distances. Therefore, gradients normal to the object’s surface\nare much larger than those along the surface. As a result, we can neglect terms that repre-\nsent x-direction diffusion of momentum, thermal energy, and chemical species, relative to\ntheir y-direction counterparts. That is [3, 4]:\n(6.25)\nBy neglecting the x-direction terms, we are assuming the net shear stress, conduction heat\nﬂux, and species diffusion ﬂux in the x-direction to be negligible. Furthermore, because the\nboundary layer is so thin, the x-direction pressure gradient within the boundary layer can be\napproximated as the free stream pressure gradient:\n(6.26)\nThe form of p\u0003(x) depends on the surface geometry and may be obtained from a separate\nconsideration of ﬂow conditions in the free stream where shear stresses are negligible [5].\nHence, the pressure gradient may be treated as a known quantity.\nWith the foregoing simpliﬁcations and approximations, the overall continuity equation\nis unchanged from Equation E.1:\n(6.27)\nThis equation is an outgrowth of applying conservation of mass to the differential,\ndx\u0003dy\u00031 control volume shown in Figure 6.9. The two terms represent the netoutﬂow\n(outﬂow minus inﬂow) of mass in the x- and y-directions, the sum of which must be zero\nfor steady ﬂow.\nThe x-momentum equation (Equation E.2) reduces to:\n(6.28)\nThis equation results from application of Newton’s second law of motion in the x-direction\nto the dx\u0003dy\u00031 differential control volume in the ﬂuid.

The first term on the right-hand side accounts for the net inflow of thermal\nenergy due to y-direction conduction. The last term on the right-hand side is what\nremains of the viscous dissipation, Equation E.5, when it is acknowledged that, in a\nboundary layer, the velocity component in the direction along the surface, u, is much\nlarger than that normal to the surface, v, and gradients normal to the surface are much larger\nthan those along the surface. In many situations this term may be neglected relative to\nthose that account for advection and conduction. However, aerodynamic heating that\naccompanies high-speed (especially supersonic) flight is a noteworthy situation in\nwhich this term is important.\nThe species conservation equation (Equation E.6) reduces to\n(6.30)\nThis equation is obtained by applying conservation of chemical species to the dx\u0003dy\u00031 differ-\nential control volume in the ﬂow. Terms on the left-hand side account for net transport of\nspecies A due to bulk ﬂuid motion (advection), while the right-hand side represents the net\ninﬂow due to y-direction diffusion.\nAfter specifying appropriate boundary conditions, Equations 6.27 through 6.30 may be\nsolved to determine the spatial variations of u, v, T, and CAin the different laminar bound-\nary layers. For incompressible, constant property ﬂow, Equations 6.27 and 6.28 are uncou-\npledfrom Equations 6.29 and 6.30. That is, Equations 6.27 and 6.28 may be solved for the\nvelocity\u0003fiel, u(x,\u0003y) and v(x,\u0003y), without consideration of Equations 6.29 and 6.30. From\nknowledge of u(x,\u0003y), the velocity gradient could then be evaluated, and the wall\nshear stress could be obtained from Equation 6.2. In contrast, through the appearance of\nuand vin Equations 6.29 and 6.30, the temperature and species concentration are coupledto\nthe velocity ﬁeld. Hence u(x,\u0003y) and v(x,\u0003y) must be known before Equations 6.29 and 6.30\nmay be solved for T(x,\u0003y) and CA(x,\u0003y). Once T(x,\u0003y) and CA(x,\u0003y) have been obtained from\nsuch solutions, the convection heat and mass transfer coefﬁcients may be determined\nfrom Equations 6.5 and 6.9, respectively. It follows that these coefﬁcients depend strongly\non the velocity ﬁeld.7\nBecause boundary layer solutions generally involve mathematics beyond the scope of\nthis text, our treatment of such solutions will be restricted to the analysis of laminar parallel(\u001du/\u001dy)\u0016y\u000f0u\u001dCA\n\u001dx\u000bv\u001dCA\n\u001dy\u000fDAB\u001d2CA\n\u001dy2396 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n7Special attention must be given to the effect of species transfer on the velocity boundary layer. Recall that\nvelocity boundary layer development is generally characterized by the existence of zero ﬂuid velocity at\u0003the\u0003sur-\nface. This condition pertains to the velocity component vnormal to the surface, as well as to the velocity compo-\nnent ualong the surface. However, if there is simultaneous mass transfer to or from the surface, it is evident that\nvcan no longer be zero at the surface. Nevertheless, for the mass transfer problems of interest in this text, it is\nreasonable to assume that v\u000f0 at the surface, which is equivalent to assuming that mass transfer has a negligi-\nble effect on the velocity boundary layer. The assumption is appropriate for many problems involving evapora-\ntion or sublimation from gas–liquid or gas–solid interfaces, respectively. It is not appropriate, however, for mass\ntransfer\u0003coolingproblems that involve large surface mass transfer rates [6]. In addition, we note that, with\nmass transfer, the boundary layer ﬂuid is a binary mixture of species A and B, and its properties should be those\nof the mixture. However, in all problems in this text, CA\u0002CBand it is reasonable to assume that the boundary\nlayer properties (such as k, \u0010, cp, etc.) are those of species B.ﬂow over a ﬂat plate (Section 7.2 and Appendix G). However, other analytical solutions are\ndiscussed in advanced texts on convection [7–9], and detailed boundary layer solutions\nmay be obtained by using numerical (ﬁnite-difference or ﬁnite-element) techniques [10]. It\nis also essential to recognize that a wide array of situations of engineering relevance\ninvolve turbulent convective heat transfer, which is both mathematically and physically\nmore complex than laminar convection. The boundary layer equations for turbulent ﬂow\nare included in Appendix F.\nIt is important to stress that we have not developed the laminar boundary layer equa-\ntions primarily for the purpose of obtaining solutions. Rather, we have been motivated\nmainly by two other considerations. One motivation has been to obtain an appreciation for\nthe physical processes that occur in boundary layers. These processes affect wall friction as\nwell as energy and species transfer in the boundary layers. A second important motivation\narises from the fact that the equations may be used to identify key boundary \u0003layer\u0003similar-\nity\u0003parameters , as well as important analogies between momentum, \u0003heat, and mass\u0003transfer\nthat have numerous practical applications. The laminar governing equations will be used\nfor this purpose in Sections 6.5 through 6.7, but the same key parameters and analogies\nhold true for turbulent conditions as well.\n6.4.2Compressible Flow\nThe equations of the foregoing section and Appendix E are restricted to incompressible ﬂows,\nthat is, for cases where the ﬂuid density can be treated as constant.8Flows in which the ﬂuids\nexperience signiﬁcant density changes as a result of pressure\u0003variations associated with the\nﬂuid motion are deemed to be compressible. The treatment of convection heat transfer associ-\nated with compressible \u0003flois beyond the scope of this text. Although liquids may nearly\nalways be treated as incompressible, density variations in ﬂowing gases should be considered\nwhen the velocity approaches or exceeds the speed of sound. Speciﬁcally, a gradual transition\nfrom incompressible to compressible ﬂow in gases occurs at a critical Mach number of \nMac\r0.3, where Ma\fV/aand Vand a\u0003are the gas velocity and speed of sound, respec-\ntively [11, 12]. For an ideal gas, a\u000f\u0019\u0017\u000bRTwhere \u000bis the ratio of speciﬁc heats, \u000b\fcp/cv, R\nis the gas constant, and the temperature is expressed in kelvins. As an example, for air at \nT\u000f300K  and p\u000f1 atm, we may assume ideal gas behavior. The gas constant is R\f\u0003/\u0004\u000f\n8315J/kmol \u0003K/28.7 kg/kmol \u000f287J/kg\u0003K and cv\fcp\fR\u000f1007J/kg \u0003K \f287J/kg\u0003K\u000f\n720J/kg\u0003K. The ratio of speciﬁc heats is therefore \u000b\u000fcp/cv\u000f1007J/kg \u0003K/720J/kg \u0003K\u000f1.4,\nand the speed of sound is a\u000f\u00191.4\r287J/kg\u0003K\r300K\u000f347m/s. Hence air ﬂowing at\n300K must be treated as being compressible if V\b0.3 \r347m/s \u000e100m/s.\nSince the material in Chapters 6 through 9 is restricted to incompressible or low-speed\nﬂow, it is important to conﬁrm that compressibility effects are not important when utilizing\nthe material to solve a convection heat transfer problem.96.4 \u0004The Boundary Layer Equations 397\n8Chapter 9 addresses ﬂows that arise due to the variation of density with temperature. These free\u0003convection\nﬂows can nearly always be treated as if the ﬂuid is incompressible but with an extra term in the momentum equa-\ntion to account for buoyancy forces.\n9Turbulence and compressibility often coincide, since large velocities can lead to large Reynolds and Mach num-\nbers. It can be shown (Problem 6.26) that, for sufﬁciently small geometries, any ﬂow that is turbulent is also\ncompressible.6.5Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized \nBoundary Layer Equations\nIf we examine Equations 6.28, 6.29, and 6.30 we note a strong similarity. In fact, if the\npressure gradient appearing in Equation 6.28 and the viscous dissipation term of Equation\n6.29 are negligible, the three equations are of the same form. Each\u0003equation\u0003is\u0003character-\nized\u0003by\u0003advection \u0003terms\u0003on\u0003the\u0003left-hand\u0003side\u0003and\u0003a\u0003diffusion\u0003term\u0003on\u0003the\u0003right-hand \u0003side.\nThis situation describes low-speed, \u0003forced\u0003convection \u0003flowswhich are found in many engi-\nneering applications. Implications of this similarity may be developed in a rational manner\nby ﬁrst nondimensionalizing the governing equations.\n6.5.1Boundary Layer Similarity Parameters\nThe boundary layer equations are normalized by ﬁrst deﬁning dimensionless independent\nvariables of the forms\n(6.31)\nwhere Lis a characteristic \u0003lengthfor the surface of interest (e.g., the length of a ﬂat plate).\nMoreover, dependent dimensionless variables may also be deﬁned as\n(6.32)\nwhere Vis the velocity upstream of the surface (Figure 6.9), and as\n(6.33)\n(6.34)\nThe dimensional variables may then be written in terms of the new dimensionless vari-\nables (for example, from Equation 6.31 x\fx*Land y\fy*L) and the resulting expres-\nsions for x, y, u, v, T, and CAmay be substituted into Equations 6.28, 6.29, and 6.30 to\nobtain the dimensionless forms of the conservation equations shown in Table 6.1. Note\nthat viscous dissipation has been neglected and that p*\f(p\u0003/\u0013V2) is a dimensionless\npressure. The y-direction boundary conditions required to solve the equations are also\nshown in the table.\nBy normalizing the boundary layer equations, three very important dimensionless simi-\nlarity\u0003parameters evolve and are introduced in Table 6.1. They are the Reynolds number,\nReL; Prandtl number, Pr; and Schmidt number, Sc. Such similarity parameters are impor-\ntant because they allow us to apply results obtained for a surface experiencing one set of\nconvective conditions to geometrically \u0003similarsurfaces experiencing entirely different con-\nditions. These conditions may vary, for example, with the ﬂuid, the ﬂuid velocity as\ndescribed by the free stream value V, and/or the size of the surface as described by the char-\nacteristic length L. As long as the similarity parameters anddimensionless boundary condi-\ntions are the same for two sets of conditions, the solutions of the differential equations of\nTable 6.1 for the nondimensional velocity, temperature, and species concentration will be\nidentical. This concept will be ampliﬁed in the remainder of this section.C*A \f CA\fCA,s\nCA,\u0003\fCA,sT* \f T\fTs\nT\u0003\fTsu* \f u\nV   and   v* \f v\nVx* \f x\nL  and  y* \f y\nL398 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to ConvectionTABLE6.1The boundary layer equations and their y-direction boundary conditions in nondimensional form\nBoundary \u0003Conditions\nBoundary Similarity\nLayer Conservation \u0003Equation Wall Free \u0003Stream Parameter(s)\nVelocity (6.35) (6.38) (6.41)\nThermal (6.36) (6.39) (6.42)\nConcentration (6.37) (6.40) (6.43) ReL, Sc\u000f\u0011\nDABC*A(x*, 0)\u000f0 C*A(x*, \u0003)\u000f1 u* \u001dC*A\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001dC*A\n\u001dy*\u000f1\nReL Sc \u001d2C*A\n\u001dy*2ReL, Pr\u000f\u0011\n\u0006T*(x*, 0)\u000f0 T*(x*, \u0003)\u000f1 u* \u001dT*\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u000f1\nReL Pr \u001d2T*\n\u001dy*2ReL\u000fVL\n\u0011u*(x*, 0)\u000f0 u*(x*, \u0003)\u000fu\u0003(x*)\nVu* \u001du*\n\u001dx*\u000bv* \u001du*\n\u001dy*\u000f \fdp*\ndx*\u000b1\nReL \u001d2u*\n \u001dy*2\nConvection \u0003Similarity \u0003Parameters \u0003ReL,\u0003Pr,\u0003and\u0003Sc6.5 \u0004Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized Boundary Layer Equations 3996.5.2Functional Form of the Solutions\nEquations 6.35 through 6.43 in Table 6.1 are extremely useful from the standpoint of sug-\ngesting how important boundary layer results may be simpliﬁed and generalized. The\nmomentum equation (6.35) suggests that, although conditions in the velocity boundary layer\ndepend on the ﬂuid properties \u0013 and \u0010, the velocity V, and the length scale L, this depen-\ndence may be simpliﬁed by grouping these variables in the form of the Reynolds number.\nWe therefore anticipate that the solution to Equation 6.35 will be of the functional form\n(6.44)\nSince the pressure distribution p*(x*) depends on the surface geometry and may be obtained\nindependently by considering ﬂow conditions in the free stream, the appearance of dp*/dx*\nin Equation 6.44 represents the inﬂuence of geometry on the velocity distribution.\nFrom Equations 6.2, 6.31, and 6.32, the shear stress at the surface, y*\u000f0, may be\nexpressed as\nand from Equations 6.1 and 6.41, it follows that the friction coefﬁcient is\nFriction\u0003Coefficient\n(6.45)\nFrom Equation 6.44 we also know that\nHence, for\u0003a\u0003prescribed \u0003geometry Equation 6.45 may be expressed as\n(6.46)\nThe signiﬁcance of this result should not be overlooked. Equation 6.46 states that the\nfriction coefﬁcient, a dimensionless parameter of considerable importance to the engineer,\nmay be expressed exclusively in terms of a dimensionless space coordinate and the\nReynolds number. Hence, for a prescribed geometry we expect the function that relates Cf\nto x* and ReLto be universally applicable. That is, we expect it to apply to different ﬂuids\nand over a wide range of values for Vand L.\nSimilar results may be obtained for the convection coefﬁcients of heat and mass trans-\nfer. Intuitively, we might anticipate that hdepends on the ﬂuid properties ( k, cp, \u0010, and \u0013),\nthe ﬂuid velocity V, the length scale L, and the surface geometry. However, Equation 6.36\nsuggests the manner in which this dependence may be simpliﬁed. In particular, the solution\nto this equation may be expressed in the form\n(6.47) T* \u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, Pr,  dp*\ndx*\u0007Cf\u000f2\nReL f(x*, ReL)\u001du*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f f \u0006x*, ReL,  dp*\ndx*\u0007Cf\u000f\u0015s\n\u0013V2/2\u000f2\nReL \u001du*\n\u001dy* \u0012\ny*\u000f0\u0015s\u000f\u0010 \u001du\n\u001dy\u0012\ny\u000f0 \u000f \u0006\u0010V\nL\u0007 \u001du*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0u* \u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, dp*\ndx*\u0007400 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convectionwhere the dependence on dp*/dx* originates from the inﬂuence of the geometry on the\nﬂuid motion ( u* and v*), which, in turn, affects the thermal conditions. Once again the term\ndp*/dx* represents the effect of surface geometry. From the deﬁnition of the convection\ncoefﬁcient, Equation 6.5, and the dimensionless variables, Equations 6.31 and 6.33, we\nalso obtain\nThis expression suggests deﬁning an important dependent dimensionless parameter termed\nthe Nusselt number.\nNusselt\u0003Number:\n(6.48)\nThis parameter is equal to the dimensionless temperature gradient at the surface, and it pro-\nvides a measure of the convection heat transfer occurring at the surface. From Equation\n6.47 it follows that, for\u0003a\u0003prescribed \u0003geometry,\n(6.49)\nThe Nusselt number is to the thermal boundary layer what the friction coefﬁcient is to\nthe velocity boundary layer. Equation 6.49 implies that for a given geometry, the Nusselt\nnumber must be some universal\u0003functionof x*, ReL, and Pr. If this function were known, it\ncould be used to compute the value of Nufor different ﬂuids and for different values of V\nand L. From knowledge of Nu, the local convection coefﬁcient hmay be found and the\nlocalheat ﬂux may then be computed from Equation 6.4. Moreover, since the averageheat\ntransfer coefﬁcient is obtained by integrating over the surface of the body, it must be inde-\npendent of the spatial variable x*. Hence the functional dependence of the averageNusselt\nnumber is\n(6.50)\nSimilarly, it may be argued that, for mass transfer in a gas ﬂow over an evaporating liq-\nuid or a sublimating solid, the convection mass transfer coefﬁcient hmdepends on the prop-\nerties DAB, \u0013, and \u0010, the velocity V, and the characteristic length L. However, Equation 6.37\nsuggests that this dependence may be simpliﬁed. The solution to this equation must be of\nthe form\n(6.51)\nwhere the dependence on dp*/dx* again originates from the inﬂuence of the ﬂuid motion.\nFrom the deﬁnition of the convection coefﬁcient, Equation 6.9, and the dimensionless vari-\nables, Equations 6.31 and 6.34, we know that\nhm\u000f\fDAB\nL (CA,\u0003\fCA,s)\n(CA,s\f CA,\u0003) \u001dCA*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f\u000b  DAB\nL \u001dCA*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0CA*\u000f f \u0006x*, y*, ReL, Sc, dp*\ndx*\u0007Nu\u000fhL\nkf\u000ff (ReL, Pr)Nu\u000ff\n (x*, ReL, Pr)Nu  \f hL\nkf \u000f \u000b  \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny* \u000f 0h\u000f\f  kf\nL (T\u0003\fTs)\n(Ts\fT\u0003) \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f0 \u000f\u000bkf\nL \u001dT*\n\u001dy*\u0012\ny*\u000f06.5 \u0004Boundary Layer Similarity: The Normalized Boundary Layer Equations 401HencewemaydeﬁneadependentdimensionlessparametertermedtheSherwoodnumber( Sh).\nSherwood \u0003Number:\n(6.52)\nThis parameter is equal to the dimensionless concentration gradient at the surface, and\nit provides a measure of the convection mass transfer occurring at the surface.

As for the Nusselt number, it is also possible to work with an aver-\nageSherwood number that depends on only ReLand Sc.\n(6.54)\nFrom the foregoing development we have obtained the relevant dimensionless parame-\nters for low-speed, forced-convection boundary layers. We have done so by nondimension-\nalizing the differential equations that describe the physical processes occurring within the\nboundary layers. An alternative approach could have involved the use of dimensional\nanalysis in the form of the Buckingham pi theorem [5]. However, the success of that\nmethod depends on one’s ability to select, largely from intuition, the various parameters\nthat inﬂuence a problem. For example, knowing beforehand that \u000ff(k,\u0003cp, \u0013, \u0010, V,\u0003L),\none could use the Buckingham pi theorem to obtain Equation 6.50. However, having begun\nwith the differential form of the conservation equations, we have eliminated the guesswork\nand have established the similarity parameters in a rigorous fashion.\nThe importance of an expression such as Equation 6.50 should be fully appreciated. It\nstates that values of the average heat transfer coefﬁcient , whether obtained theoretically,\nexperimentally, or numerically, can be completely represented in terms of only three dimen-\nsionless groups, instead of the original seven dimensional parameters. The convenience and\npower afforded by such simpliﬁcation will become evident in Chapters 7 through 10. More-\nover, once the form of the functional dependence of Equation 6.50 has been obtained for a\nparticular surface geometry, let us say from laboratory measurements, it is known to be uni-\nversallyapplicable. By this we mean that it may be applied for different ﬂuids, velocities,\nand length scales, as long as the assumptions implicit in the originating boundary layer equa-\ntions remain valid (e.g., negligible viscous dissipation and body forces).\nEXAMPLE6.5\nExperimental tests using air as the working ﬂuid are conducted on a portion of the turbine\nblade shown in the sketch.

Consider the Reynolds\u0003number ReL(Equation\n6.41), which may be interpreted as the ratio\u0003of\u0003inertia\u0003to\u0003viscous\u0003forcesin a region of char-\nacteristic dimension L. Inertia forces are associated with an increase in the momentum of a\nmoving ﬂuid. From Equation 6.28, it is evident that these forces (per unit mass) are of the\nform , in which case an order-of-magnitude approximation gives FI\rV2/L. Simi-\nlarly, the net shear force (per unit mass) is found on the right-hand side of Equation 6.28 as\n\u0011( ) and may be approximated as Fs\r\u0011V/L2. Therefore, the ratio of forces is\nWe therefore expect inertia forces to dominate for large values of ReLand viscous forces to\ndominate for small values of ReL.\nThere are several important implications of this result. Recall from Section 6.3.1 that\nthe Reynolds number determines the existence of laminar or turbulent ﬂow. We should also\nexpect the magnitude of the Reynolds number to inﬂuence the velocity boundary layer\nthickness \t. With increasing ReLat a ﬁxed location on a surface, we expect viscous forces\nto become less inﬂuential relative to inertia forces. Hence the effects of viscosity do not\npenetrate as far into the free stream, and the value of \t diminishes.\nThe Prandtl\u0003numberis deﬁned as the ratio of the kinematic viscosity, also referred to\nas the momentum diffusivity, \u0011, to the thermal diffusivity \u0006. It is therefore a ﬂuid property.\nThe Prandtl number provides a measure\u0003of\u0003the\u0003relative\u0003effectiveness \u0003of\u0003momentum \u0003and\nenergy\u0003transport\u0003by\u0003diffusion\u0003in\u0003the\u0003velocity\u0003and\u0003thermal\u0003boundary \u0003layers, respectively.\nFrom Table A.4 we see that the Prandtl number of gases is near unity, in which case energy\nand momentum transfer by diffusion are comparable. In a liquid metal (Table A.7), Pr\u00021\nand the energy diffusion rate greatly exceeds the momentum diffusion rate. The opposite is\ntrue for oils (Table A.5), for which Pr\u0003\u00161. From this interpretation it follows that the value\nof Prstrongly inﬂuences the relative growth of the velocity and thermal boundary layers. In\nfact for laminar boundary layers (in which transport by diffusion is notovershadowed by\nturbulent mixing), it is reasonable to expect that\n(6.55)\nwhere nis a positive exponent. Hence for a gas \tt\r\t; for a liquid metal \tt\u0016\t; for an oil\n\tt\u0002\t.\nSimilarly, the Schmidt\u0003number,which is deﬁned in Equation 6.43, is a ﬂuid property\nand provides a\u0003measure\u0003of\u0003the\u0003relative\u0003effectiveness \u0003of\u0003momentum \u0003and\u0003mass\u0003transport\u0003by\ndiffusion\u0003in\u0003the\u0003velocity\u0003and\u0003concentration \u0003boundary \u0003layers, respectively.

The list includes groups already considered, as well as those yet to be introduced for\nspecial conditions. As a new group is confronted, its deﬁnition and interpretation should be\ncommitted to memory. Note that the Grashof\u0003numberprovides a measure of the ratio of\nbuoyancy forces to viscous forces in the velocity boundary layer. Its role in free convection\n(Chapter 9) is much the same as that of the Reynolds number in forced convection. The\nEckert\u0003numberprovides a measure of the kinetic energy of the ﬂow relative to the enthalpy\ndifference across the thermal boundary layer. It plays an important role in high-speed ﬂows\nfor which viscous dissipation is signiﬁcant. Note also that, although similar in form, the\nNusselt and Biot numbers differ in both deﬁnition and interpretation.

From knowledge of these parameters, we may\ncompute the wall shear stress and the convection heat and mass transfer rates. It is there-\nfore understandable that expressions that relate Cf, Nu, and Shto each other can be useful\ntools in convection analysis. Such expressions are available in the form of boundary \u0003layer\nanalogies.6.7 \u0004Boundary Layer Analogies 409410 Chapter 6 \u0004Introduction to Convection\n6.7.1The Heat and Mass Transfer Analogy\nIf two or more processes are governed by dimensionless equations of the same form, the\nprocesses are said to be analogous. Clearly, then, from Equations 6.36 and 6.37 and the\nboundary conditions, Equations 6.39 and 6.40, of Table 6.1, convection heat and mass\ntransfer are analogous. Each of the differential equations is composed of advection and dif-\nfusion terms of the same form. Moreover, as shown in Equations 6.36 and 6.37, each equa-\ntion is related to the velocity ﬁeld through ReL, and the parameters Prand Scassume\nanalogous roles. One implication of this analogy is that dimensionless relations that govern\nthermal boundary layer behavior must be of the same form as those that govern the concen-\ntration boundary layer. Hence the boundary layer temperature and concentration proﬁles\nmust also be of the same functional form if the applied boundary conditions are analogous.\nRecalling the discussion of Section 6.5.2, the features of which are summarized in\nTable 6.3, an important result of the heat and mass transfer analogy may be obtained. From\nthe foregoing paragraph, it follows that Equation 6.47 must be of the same functional form\nas Equation 6.51. From Equations 6.48 and 6.52, it then follows that the dimensionless\ntemperature and concentration gradients evaluated at the surface, and therefore the values\nof Nuand Sh, are analogous. Similarly, expressions for the average Nusselt and Sherwood\nnumbers, Equations 6.50 and 6.54, respectively, are also of the same form. Accordingly,\nheat\u0003and\u0003mass\u0003transfer\u0003relations\u0003for\u0003a\u0003particular \u0003geometry\u0003are\u0003interchangeable. If, for\nexample, one has performed a set of heat transfer experiments to determine the functional\nform of Equation 6.49 for a particular surface geometry, the results may be used for con-\nvection mass transfer involving the same geometry, simply by replacing Nuwith Shand Pr\nwith Sc.\nThe analogy may also be used to directly relate the two convection coefﬁcients. In sub-\nsequent chapters we will ﬁnd that Nuand Share generally proportional to Prnand Scn,\nrespectively, where nis a positive exponent less than 1.

The same relation may be applied to the average\ncoefﬁcients h–and h–\nm, and it may be used in turbulent, as well as laminar, ﬂow. For most\napplications it is reasonable to assume a value of n\u000f.\nEXAMPLE6.7 \nA solid of arbitrary shape is suspended in atmospheric air having a free stream temperature\nand velocity of 20 \u0011C and 100m/s, respectively. The solid has a characteristic length of 1m,\nand its surface is maintained at 80 \u0011C. Under these conditions measurements of the convec-\ntion heat ﬂux at a particular point ( x*) on the surface and of the temperature in the bound-\nary layer above this point ( x*, y*) reveal values of 104W/m2and 60\u0011C, respectively.

Evaporation\noccurs from the liquid surface, and the energy associated with the phase change is the latent\nheat of vaporization of the liquid. Evaporation occurs when liquid molecules near the sur-\nface experience collisions that increase their energy above that needed to overcome the\nsurface binding energy. The energy required to sustain the evaporation must come from the\ninternal energy of the liquid, which would then experience a reduction in temperature (the\ncooling effect). However, if steady-state conditions are to be maintained, the latent energy\nlost by the liquid because of evaporation must be replenished by energy transfer to the liq-\nuid from its surroundings. Neglecting radiation effects, this transfer may be due to the con-\nvection of sensible energy from the gas or to heat addition by other means, as, for example,\nby an electrical heater submerged in the liquid. Applying conservation of energy to a con-\ntrol surface about the liquid (Equation 1.12c), it follows that, for a unit surface area,\n(6.61) q\nconv\u000bq\nadd\u000fq\nevapN\nA(x*)\u000f3.54\r10\f4\n kmol/s\u0003m2N\nA(x*)\u000f0.077  m/s (0.0046 \f0.0)  kmol/m3 hm\u000f0.077  m/s hm\u000fL1\nL2\rDAB\nk\rq\n(Ts\fT\u0003)\u000f 1\n2\r0.26\r10\f4\n m2/s\n0.028  W/m\u0003K\r104\n W/m2\n(80\f20)\u0011CSh\u000fhmL2\nDAB\u000fNu\u000fhL1\nkx*1\u000fx*2N\nA(x*)\u000fhm(CA,s\fCA,\u0003)CA(x*, y*)\u000f0.67 (0.0046  kmol/m3)\u000f0.0031  kmol/m36.7 \u0004Boundary Layer Analogies 413where may be approximated as the product of the evaporative mass ﬂux and the latent\nheat of vaporization\n(6.62)\nIf there is no heat addition by other means, Equation 6.61 reduces to a balance between\nconvection heat transfer from the gas and the evaporative heat loss from the liquid.

For a ﬂat plate parallel to the incoming ﬂow, we have\ndp*/dx*\u000f0 and there is no variation in the free stream velocity outside the boundary\nlayer. With u\u0003\u000fV, Equations 6.38 through 6.40 also have the same form. Hence the func-\ntional forms of the solutions for u*, T*, and C*A, Equations 6.44, 6.47, and 6.51, must be\nequivalent. From Equations 6.45, 6.48, and 6.52, it follows that\n(6.66)\nReplacing Nuand Shby the Stanton\u0003number(St) and the mass\u0003transfer\u0003Stanton\u0003number\n(Stm), respectively,\n(6.67)\n(6.68)\nEquation 6.66 may also be expressed in the form\n(6.69)\nEquation 6.69 is known as the Reynolds analogy, and it relates the key engineer-\ning parameters of the velocity, thermal, and concentration boundary layers. If the\nvelocity parameter is known, the analogy may be used to obtain the other parameters,\nand vice versa. However, there are restrictions associated with using this result. In\naddition to relying on the validity of the boundary layer approximations, the accuracy\nof Equation 6.69 depends on having PrandSc1 anddp*/dx* 0.

For lami-\nnar ﬂow Equations 6.70 and 6.71 are only appropriate when dp*/dx*\u00070, but in turbulent\nﬂow, conditions are less sensitive to the effect of pressure gradients and these equations\nremain approximately valid. If the analogy is applicable at every point on a surface, it may\nbe applied to the surface average coefﬁcients.\n6.8Summary\nIn this chapter we have considered several fundamental issues related to convection trans-\nport phenomena. In the process, however, you should not lose sight of what remains the\nproblem\u0003of\u0003convection. Our primary objective is still one of developing means to determine\nthe convection coefﬁcients hand hm. Although these coefﬁcients may be obtained by solv-\ning the boundary layer equations, it is only for simple ﬂow situations that such solutions are\nreadily effected. The more practical approach frequently involves calculating hand hmfrom\nempirical relations of the form given by Equations 6.49 and 6.53. The particular form of\nthese equations is obtained by correlating measured convection heat and mass transfer\nresults in terms of appropriate dimensionless groups. It is this approach that is emphasized\nin the chapters that follow.\nTo test your comprehension of the material, you should challenge yourself with appro-\npriate questions.\n• What is the difference between a localconvection heat transfer coefﬁcient and an aver-\nagecoefﬁcient?
